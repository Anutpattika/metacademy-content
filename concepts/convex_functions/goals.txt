* Know the definition of a convex function (in multiple dimensions)
* Know and be able to apply alternative characterizations of convex functions
** first-order condition (linear approximation lies below the function)
** second-order condition (second derivative matrix is positive semidefinite)
* Know some examples of convex functions
* Why can the value of the function outside its domain be taken to be infinity?
