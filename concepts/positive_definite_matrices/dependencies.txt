tag: matrix_transpose
reason: PD matrices are usually assumed to be symmetric.

tag: matrix_multiplication
reason: PD matrices are defined in terms of matrix-vector multiplications.

tag: eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors
reason: A symmetric matrix is positive definite iff the eigenvalues are all positive.
shortcut: 1

tag: spectral_decomposition
reason: A symmetric matrix is positive definite iff the eigenvalues are all positive.
shortcut: 1

tag: matrix_inverse
reason: PD matrices are closed under matrix inverses.
