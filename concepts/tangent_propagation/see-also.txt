* Some other strategies for learning invariances:
** building it explicitly into the architecture, as in "convolutional nets":convolutional_nets
** "augmenting the training set":augmenting_training_set_warped with warped examples
** "Tikhonov regularization":tikhonov_regularization, which penalizes instability with respect to noise
