* MRF parameter learning is a special case of "maximum likelihood in exponential families":maximum_likelihood_in_exponential_families.
** As with exponential families, maximum likelihood in MRFs can be interpreted in terms of "maximum entropy":maximum_likelihood_and_maximum_entropy.
* We shouldn't expect to learn the parameters exactly in the general case, since "inference in MRFs is hard":complexity_of_inference.
* Some algorithms for learning the parameters:
** "iterative proportional fitting":iterative_proportional_fitting
** "contrastive divergence":contrastive_divergence
