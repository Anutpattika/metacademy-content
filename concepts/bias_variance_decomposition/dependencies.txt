tag: linear_regression
reason: The bias-variance decomposition holds exactly in the case of linear regression.

tag: linear_regression_closed_form
reason: The bias-variance decomposition can be derived from the closed-form solution to linear regression.

tag: generalization
reason: The bias-variance decomposition is a way of analyzing generalization error.
