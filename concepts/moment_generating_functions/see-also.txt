* MGFs are an important tool for proving several important results:
** "central limit theorem":central_limit_theorem, which characterizes the limiting distribution of the mean of i.i.d. random variables
** "Chernoff bounds":chernoff_bounds, which bound the probability of sums of random variables taking extreme values
* MGFs are "closely related":mgf_and_fourier_transform to the "Fourier transform":fourier_transform.
