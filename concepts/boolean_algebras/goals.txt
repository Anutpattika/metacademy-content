* Define a lattice
* Define a Boolean algebra (as a complemented distributed lattice)
* Be able to prove simple facts about Boolean algebras
* Show that the power set of a set, with the standard set operations, forms a Boolean algebra
* Give an example of a Boolean algebra which is not a power set
* Define an atom
* Be aware of the principle of duality (that Boolean algebras are symmetric with respect to meet and join)
