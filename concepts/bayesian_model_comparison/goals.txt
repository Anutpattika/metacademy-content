* Know what the marginal likelihood of a model refers to
* Motivate the marginal likelihood in terms of Bayes factors
* Understand the basis for the "Bayesian Occam's razor" effect (hint: it's not primarily a result of assigning lower prior probability to models with more parameters, as many people believe)
* Derive the Bayes factor for a simple example (e.g. a beta-Bernoulli model)
