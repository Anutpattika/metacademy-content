* From a Bayesian standpoint, it's better to average predictions over many models than to select just one. This is known as "Bayesian model averaging":bayesian_model_averaging.
* Some general classes of methods for estimating Bayes factors include:
** "sequential Monte Carlo":smc_partition_function
** "Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)":mcmc_partition_function
** "variational Bayes":variational_bayes
