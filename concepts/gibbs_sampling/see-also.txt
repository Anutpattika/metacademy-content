* Gibbs sampling can be viewed as a "special case of Metropolis-Hastings":gibbs_as_mh.
* Naive Gibbs sampling is often very slow to mix. Some improved versions include:
** "block Gibbs sampling":block_gibbs_sampling, where we sample multiple variables at a time
** "collapsed Gibbs sampling":collapsed_gibbs_sampling, where some of the variables are integrated out in closed form
* "Slice sampling":slice_sampling is a special case of Gibbs sampling, good for sampling from univariate distributions with no closed-form sampler
* We can "analyze the mixing rate":analyzing_mcmc_mixing using spectral graph theory.
