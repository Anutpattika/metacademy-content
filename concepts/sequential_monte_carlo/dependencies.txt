tag: particle_filter
reason: The particle filter is a canonical example of a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm.

tag: importance_sampling
reason: Importance sampling is one step of sequential Monte Carlo algorithms.

tag: expectation_and_variance
reason: Sequential Monte Carlo algorithms yield unbiased estimators of expectations.

tag: markov_chain_monte_carlo
reason: The rejuvenation step involves applying an MCMC operator.
