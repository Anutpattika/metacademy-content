* Understand why each of the following operators preserves weighted samples:
** importance weighting
** sampling from the sampling (proposal) distribution
** resampling
** rejuvenation
* Know how to use SMC to estimate the normalizing constant of a distribution
* What is the optimal sampling (proposal) distribution?
** Know how this can be approximated using look-ahead
