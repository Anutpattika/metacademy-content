* Gaussian elimination can be viewed as "factorizing a matrix":lu_factorization into a lower triangular and an upper triangular matrix.
* If the matrix is symmetric positive definite, we never need to pivot; in this case, the algorithm is known as the "Cholesky decomposition":cholesky_decomposition.
