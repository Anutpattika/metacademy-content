* The "Markov blanket":markov_blanket is another characterization of Bayes nets in terms of conditional independencies.
* The d-separation criterion presented here is inefficient when implemented as an algorithm. The "Bayes Ball algorithm":bayes_ball gives an efficient way of testing conditional independence.
