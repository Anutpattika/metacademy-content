* Know the steps of the particle filter algorithm.
* Be aware that an important advantage of the algorithm is that it does not require storing the entire history.
* Be aware that the following are major sources of variance in the estimator, and that effective performance can depend on the details of the implementation:
** the proposal distribution
** the resampling method
