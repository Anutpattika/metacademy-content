* "Gibbs sampling":gibbs_sampling is a commonly used "special case":gibbs_as_mg of M-H.
* Other examples of M-H methods include:
** "Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)":hamiltonian_monte_carlo, which uses gradient information to sample from continuous models
** "split-merge":split_merge operators, which try to split or merge clusters
** "reversible jump MCMC":reversible_jump_mcmc, which tries to move between spaces of different dimensionality 
* Under certain conditions, we can determine the "optimal M-H acceptance rate":optimal_mcmc_acceptance_rate.
