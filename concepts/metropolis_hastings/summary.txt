Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a method for approximately sampling from a distribution p by defining a Markov chain which has p as a stationary distribution. Metropolis-Hastings is a very general recipe for finding such a Markov chain: choose a proposal distribution and correct for the bias by stochastically accepting or rejecting the proposal. While the mathematical formalism is very general, there is an art to choosing good proposal distributions.
