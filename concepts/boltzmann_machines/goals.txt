* Know the definition of a Boltzmann machine (i.e. what distribution it represents)
* Be able to (approximately) sample from a Boltzmann machine using Gibbs sampling.
* Derive the fact that the model correlations must match the data correlations at the maximum likelihood solution.
* Why can it be beneficial to add hidden units to the network?
* Be aware of the analogies between Boltzmann machine updates and Hopfield network updates.
