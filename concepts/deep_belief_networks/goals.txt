* Know the graphical model structure of a DBN and understand what the combination of directed and undirected edges represents.
* Understand why the explaining away effect makes exact inference in a DBN intractable.
* Know how to train a DBN in a layerwise fashion.
* Optional: understand mathematically why layerwise training is guaranteed to improve the likelihood.
