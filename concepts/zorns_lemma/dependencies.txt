tag: order_relations
reason: Zorn's Lemma is stated in terms of partial orderings.

tag: axiom_of_choice
reason: Zorn's Lemma is equivalent to the Axiom of Choice.

tag: functions_and_relations_as_sets
reason: Proving Zorn's Lemma requires viewing relations as sets.

tag: well_ordering
reason: Zorn's Lemma is proved using transfinite recursion.

tag: bases
reason: A canonical application of Zorn's Lemma is to show that every vector space has a basis.
