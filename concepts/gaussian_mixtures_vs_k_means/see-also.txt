* Other clustering methods include:
** "naive Bayes":naive_bayes, a probabilistic model for discrete data
** "spectral clustering":spectral_clustering, for when the clusters don't have nice convex shapes
* The application of clustering to finding meaningful regions of images is called "image segmentation":image_segmentation.
