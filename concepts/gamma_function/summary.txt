The gamma function is a generalization of factorials to real and complex numbers, e.g. 5.25! isn't well defined, but Gamma(5.25) is well defined. The Gamma function is formally defined as an improper integral that converges. It appears in a number of common distributions, e.g. the beta, gamma, and Dirichlet distribution.
