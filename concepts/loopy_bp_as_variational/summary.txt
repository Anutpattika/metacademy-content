Loopy belief propagation sounds like a hack, but it can be interpreted as a variational inference algorithm. In particular, it is a fixed point update for an approximation to variational inference, where both the energy functional and the marginal polytope are approximated. While this analysis doesn't lead to any strong guarantees, it is the basis for generalizations of loopy BP which have stronger guarantees.
