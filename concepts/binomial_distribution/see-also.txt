* The "multinomial distribution":multinomial_distribution is the analog of the binomial distribution where each event can take more than two values.
* The probability parameter can be estimated from data using "maximum likelihood":maximum_likelihood.
* The "Poisson distribution":poisson_distribution is the limiting case as the number of trials goes to infinty and the success probability goes to zero.
* When the number of trials is large, the binomial distribution is well approximated by the Gaussian distribution. This follows from the "Central Limit Theorem":central_limit_theorem.
