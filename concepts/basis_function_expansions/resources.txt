extra: watch from 3:20 for an overview of using basis functions with linear regression

source: esl
location Section 5.1 provides a good overview and Section 5.2 provides a detailed explanation of common basis functions (piecewise polynomials and splines)
mark: star
extra: the remainder of chapter 5 provides a good reference for using spline and wavelet basis functions
