* How are the requirements for structure learning different if your goal is knowledge discovery or density modeling?
** In particular, if the goal is density modeling, why might you want a graph which is sparser than the true one?
* Why isn't the maximum likelihood score appropriate for evaluating graph structures?
* Be able to derive the Bayesian (marginal likelihood) score for evaluating Bayes nets.
** What assumptions about the prior are needed for the solution to have a convenient closed form?
** The Bayesian score implicitly penalizes complex graphs. Why does this happen?  (Hint: it's not the prior over graph structures, as you might expect!)
* Give an example where the graph is not identifiable, i.e. there are multiple graph structures which yield the same set of distributions.
* Give an example where the graph structure is identifiable.
