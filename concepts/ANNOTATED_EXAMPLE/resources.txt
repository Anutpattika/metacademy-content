# this file provides a list of resources the user can consult to learn about the topic
# The resources are given as lists of field/value pairs, and the resources are separated by blank lines. The following fields are conventionally specified in the node-specific resources list:
# location, the location(s) within the resource which the user should read/watch. If there are multiple locations, each one should be listed as a separate location field. If there is a URL associated with the location, put it in brackets at the end of the line. If the resource has a specific_url_base specified (see global resources.txt), it will be prepended to each of the location URLs. (This can be overridden by starting the URL with http: or https:.)
edition, the edition number of a textbook. Currently this isn't used, but we are planning to allow resources to be added for multiple editions of a textbook, and the user can choose which one is to be displayed.
mark, an annotation for the node. Currently, the only mark is star, which indicates that the resource is well-written and fits nicely with the structure of the concept map. (Generally, we're expecting that the user would start with a starred resource, and maybe go to one of the other ones for additional clarification.)
dependencies, a comma-separated list of tags representing additional concepts that resource depends on which aren't already given by the graph structure
