* "Generalized linear models":generalized_linear_models are a generalization of linear regression where the observation model is an exponential family distribution.
* A lot of aspects of statistical modeling wind up having convenient forms for exponential families:
** "conjugate priors":bayes_param_exp_fam
** "maximum likelihood estimation":maximum_likelihood_in_exponential_families
** "variational inference":variational_exponential_family, a kind of approximate probabilistic inference algorithm
* Markov random fields "can be viewed":mrfs_as_exponential_families as exponential families.
