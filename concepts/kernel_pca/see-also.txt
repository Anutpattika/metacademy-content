* Some other ways of learning nonlinear representations of data:
** "feed-forward neural nets":feed_forward_neural_nets, which adapt the representations in the context of some other learning objective
** "spectral embeddings":spectral_embeddings, a very similar algorithm based on spectral graph theory
