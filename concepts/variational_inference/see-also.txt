* Some examples of variational inference algorithms:
** "Mean field approximation":mean_field_approximation
** "Structured variational approximations":structured_variational_approximations in graphical models
** "Expectation propagation":expectation_propagation, which is slower, but often considerably more accurate, than mean field
* Variational inference "works out nicely":variational_exponential_family when the model is built out of exponential family distributions.
* "Variational Bayes":variational_bayes is the application of variational inference to fitting Bayesian models.
* "Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)":markov_chain_monte_carlo is another versatile set of techniques for performing inference in probabilistic models.
* In the case of graphical models, "belief propagation":loopy_belief_propagation is another inference algorithm with a "variational interpretation":loopy_bp_as_variational.
