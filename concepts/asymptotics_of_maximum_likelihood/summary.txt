Under certain regularity conditions, the maximum likelihood estimator is consistent, i.e. it asymptotically approaches the true value. Its sampling distribution (when rescaled appropriately) approaches a normal distribution whose variance is determined by the Fisher information. Because of the Cramer-Rao bound, this is the best we can do. The asymptotic analysis is useful for constructing confidence intervals for parameter estimates.
