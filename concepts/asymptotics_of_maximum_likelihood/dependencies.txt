tag: maximum-likelihood

tag: fisher-information
reason: The asymptotic covariance of the maximum likelihood estimate is determined by Fisher information.
 
tag: gaussian_distribution
reason: The maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters is approximately Gaussian in the large data limit.

tag: confidence_intervals
reason: The asymptotics of maximum likelihood are used to construct confidence intervals.
