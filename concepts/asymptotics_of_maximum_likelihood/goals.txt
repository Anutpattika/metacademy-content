* Understand basic properties of maximum likelihood estimators:
** they are consistent (they approach the correct value in the limit)
** asymptotically, their sampling distribution (rescaled appropriately) approaches a normal distribution whose variance is the inverse Fisher information
** they are efficient (no unbiased estimator has smaller variance asymptotically)
* Note: for the multivariate version of the asymptotic normality result, you'll want to know about the "Fisher information matrix":fisher_information_matrix.
