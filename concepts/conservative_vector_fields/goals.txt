* Know the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for line integrals
* Know what a conservative vector field is and why it is useful
* Show the equivalence of two definitions of a conservative vector field:
** can be expressed as the gradient of a function
** line integrals are independent of the path
* Know the definition of the curl of a vector field
* Be able to tell if a vector field is conservative by determining if the curl is 0
