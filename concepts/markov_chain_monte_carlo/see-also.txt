* Some commonly used MCMC algorithms include:
** "Gibbs sampling":gibbs_sampling, where one variable is resampled given the others 
** "Metropolis-Hastings":metropolis_hastings, a very general technique
* "Sequential importance sampling":sequential_importance_sampling is an alternative family of sampling techniques. 
* While MCMC is normally used as an approximate inference technique, it can also be used to get "exact samples":mcmc_exact_samples.
* We can "analyze the mixing rate":analyzing_mcmc_mixing of MCMC samplers using spectral graph theory.
