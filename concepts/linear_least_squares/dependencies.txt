tag: linear_systems_as_matrices
reason: Linear least squares generalizes solving systems of linear equations.

tag: projection_onto_a_subspace
reason: Projection is used in the solution.

tag: matrix_transpose
reason: The matrix transpose is used in the normal equations.

tag: partial_derivatives
reason: The solution can be derived using partial derivatives.

tag: four_fundamental_subspaces
reason: The solution can be derived geometrically in terms of column spaces and nullspaces.
