* Other clustering methods include:
** "mixture of Gaussians":gaussian_mixtures_vs_k_means, a probabilistic model for continuous data
** "mixture of Bernoullis":mixture_of_bernoullis, a probabilistic model for discrete data
** "spectral clustering":spectral_clustering, for when the clusters don't have nice convex shapes
