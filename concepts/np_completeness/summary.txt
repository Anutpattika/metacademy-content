A problem L is NP-complete if it is in NP and every other problem in NP can be reduced to L. NP-complete problems are therefore the "hardest" problems in NP: if any NP-complete problem has a polynomial time solution, then P = NP. Many widely studied problems are NP-complete, and practically speaking, one might as well give up looking for polynomial time algorithms for such problems.
