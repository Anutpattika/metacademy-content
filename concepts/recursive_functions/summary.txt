Recursive functions are a kind of mathematical function which, if the Church-Turing hypothesis is correct, correspond to functions which can be computed algorithmically. A subclass knows as primitive recursive functions consists of functions computable by programs where a bound on the number of steps can be calculated in advance. Recursive functions are useful for formalizing notions of computability, because the notion of a recursive function is more precise than that of an algorithm.
