* The forward-backward algorithm can be interpreted as a "special case of belief propagation":hmm_inference_as_bp.
* "Kalman smoothing":kalman_as_forward_backward can be viewed as a special case of forward-backward, where the variables are all jointly Gaussian. 
* This algorithm is part of the "Baum-Welch algorithm":baum_welch_algorithm for learning HMM parameters.
* The forward-backward algorithm is an example of "dynamic programming":dynamic_programming.
