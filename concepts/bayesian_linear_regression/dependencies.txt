reason: Bayesian linear regression is based on the probabilistic interpretation of linear regression.

tag: bayesian-parameter-estimation
reason: This is an example of Bayesian parameter estimation.

tag: bayes_param_multivariate_gaussian
reason: Bayesian linear regression uses some of the same computations as Bayesian inference for multivariate Gaussians.

tag: computations-on-multivariate-gaussians
reason: Bayesian linear regression requires conditioning and marginalizing multivariate Gaussians.
