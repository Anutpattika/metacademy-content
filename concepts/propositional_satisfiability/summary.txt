Propositional satisfiability (SAT) is a computational problem where one is given a setence in propositional logic, and one wants to determine if there is a satisfying assignment (an assignment of truth values to all the variables which makes the assignment true). SAT is central to computer science because it is the prototypical NP-complete problem and because SAT solvers underly a lot of automated reasoning systems.
