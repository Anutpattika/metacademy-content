* Know what the K nearest neighbors algorithm is.
* Be aware of the tradeoffs of KNN vs. parameteric models, including:
** KNN requires no work at training time, but lots of work at test time
** KNN can learn arbitrarily complex functions
** KNN requires storing the entire training set
** KNN is especially prone to the curse of dimensionality
* Derive the asymptotic classification error of KNN, both with K = 1 and with K increasing.
