* Memorize the five Bayes ball "bouncing rules" for unobserved/unconditioned nodes and realize that the rules are exact oposites for observed/conditioned nodes (in total, there are ten rules).
** You should be able to prove the bouncing rules using the definition of conditional probability.
* Understand how "marking" the nodes depending on the direction the ball is traveling when visiting the node can lead to a linear-time algorithm for determining the [conditional] independencies in a Bayes net.
