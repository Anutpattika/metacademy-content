D-separation gives a way of determining conditional independence properties of a Bayes net from the graphical representation, but unfortunately the definition itself doesn't give a practical algorithm. Bayes ball is an efficient algorithm for computing d-separation by passing simple messages between nodes of the graph. The name "Bayes Ball" stems from the idea of balls bouncing around a directed graph, where if a ball cannot bounce between two nodes then they are [conditionally] independent.
