Linear regression is an algorithm for learning to predict a real-valued ``target'' variable as a linear function of one or more real-valued ``input'' variables. It is one of the most widely used statistical learning algorithms, and with care it can be made to work very well in practice. Because it has a closed-form solution, we can exactly analyze many properties of linear regression which have no exact form for other models. This makes it a useful starting point for understanding many other statistical learning algorithms.
