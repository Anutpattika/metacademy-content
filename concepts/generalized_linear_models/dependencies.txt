reason: Maximum likelihood is an optimization problem.

tag: linear-regression_as_maximum_likelihood
reason: Linear regression is an instructive example of a generalized linear model.

tag: gradient_descent
reason: The gradient ascent update rule for generalized linear models has a convenient form.
