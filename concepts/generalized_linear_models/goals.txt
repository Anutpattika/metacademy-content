* Understand the basic assumptions behind a generalized linear model.
** In particular, the natural parameters are assumed to be a linear function of the inputs. What role does this play in the maximum likelihood update rule?
* Show that some other model (e.g. linear regression or logistic regression) is a special case of generalized linear models.
* Derive the gradient ascent update rule for GLMs.
