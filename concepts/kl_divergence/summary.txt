KL divergence, roughly speaking, is a measure of the distance between two probability distributions P and Q, and corresponds to the number of extra bits required to encode samples from P using an optimal code for Q. It is not truly a distance function, because it's not symmetric and it doesn't satisfy the triangle inequality. Despite this, it's widely used in information theory and probabilistic inference.
