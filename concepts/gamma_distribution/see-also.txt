* The gamma distribution is used to construct a "prior for the scale parameters":bayesian_parameter_estimation_gaussian in Bayesian parameter estimation. 
* The gamma distribution is a member of the "exponential family":exponential_family.
* The "Wishart distribution":wishart_distribution is a generalization of the gamma distribution to positive semidefinite matrices.
* Some special cases of the gamma distribution:
** "exponential distribution":exponential_distribution
** "chi-squared distribution":chi_squared_distribution
* The "student-t distribution":student_t_distribution is a heavy-tailed distribution constructed from the Gaussian distribution and gamma distribution.
* Gamma distributions are used to model the "intervals between neuronal firings":neuronal_firings_gamma.
