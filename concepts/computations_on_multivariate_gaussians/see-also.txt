* Some probabilistic models allow for more efficient conditioning by exploiting problem structure:
** "Gaussian Markov random fields":gaussian_markov_random_fields, which exploit sparsity in the precision matrix
** "Linear-Gaussian models":linear_gaussian_models, which exploit sparsity in the Cholesky decomposition
