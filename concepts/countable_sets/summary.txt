A set is countably infinite if it can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers. Countably infinite sets include the natural numbers, the rationals, and the algebraic numbers -- surprisingly, these are all "the same size" in the set-theoretic sense. By contrast, the set of real numbers is uncountably infinite. The more general notion of cardinality lets us distinguish different "sizes" of infinity.
