* Be able to compute line integrals of vector fields with respect to curves
* Be able to express the line integral in terms of the arc length parameterization, or in terms of an arbitrary parameterization
* Why does the line integral of a vector field depend on the orientation of a curve?
* Be aware that the line integrals are independent of the parameterization of a path, for a given orientation
