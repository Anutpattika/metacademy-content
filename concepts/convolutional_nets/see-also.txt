* Convolutional nets are one way to get invariances in a neural net representation. Other ways include:
** "augmenting the training set with warped examples":augmenting_training_set_wapred
** "tangent propagation":tangent_propagation, which penalizes instability with respect to transformations
** "Tikhonov regularization":tikhonov_regularization, which penalizes instability with respect to noise
* "Learning invariances":learning_invariances_in_neural_nets is a major goal in the field of representation learning.
* Convolutional neural nets learn oriented filters similar to the "receptive fields in the human primary visual cortex":representations_in_v1.
