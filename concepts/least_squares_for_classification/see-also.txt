* The problem with this algorithm is that the cost function isn't well-suited to classification. Some alternatives which make more sense are:
** "logistic regression":logistic_regression
** "support vector machines (SVMs)":support_vector_machines
* The least squares solution, surprisingly, turns out to be "equivalent":gda_is_least_squares to "Gaussian discriminant analysis":gaussian_discriminant_analysis.
