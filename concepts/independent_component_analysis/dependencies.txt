tag: heavy_tailed_distributions
reason: ICA typically involves fitting heavy-tailed distributions.

tag: principal_component_analysis
reason: PCA is often used as a preprocessing step, and it's useful to compare ICA with PCA.

tag: maximum_likelihood
reason: ICA is usually fit using maximum likelihood.
shortcut: 1

tag: determinant
reason: The maximum likelihood objective function includes a determinant.

tag: orthonormal_bases
reason: Standard ICA has an orthogonality constraint.

tag: multivariate_gaussian_distribution
reason: ICA requires that the component distributions be non-Gaussian.
shortcut: 1

# TODO: linear transformations of densities

tag: optimization_problems
reason: Fitting ICA requires solving an optimization problem.
