* Some other techniques for learning meaningful representations of data:
** "manifold learning":manifold_learning, where we try to embed points in a low-dimensional space where similar points are close together
** "sparse coding":sparse_coding, a generative model similar to ICA, but which gives an overcomplete representation (i.e. larger than the input representation)
* ICA is often used for learning representations of:
** "images":learning_representations_of_images
** "audio":learning_representations_of_audio
* "FastICA":fast_ica is an efficient algorithm for fitting ICA models.
