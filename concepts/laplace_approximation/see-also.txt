* Some other approximations to Bayesian parameter estimation include:
** "variational Bayes":variational_bayes
** "Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)":markov_chain_monte_carlo
* The "Bayesian information criterion (BIC)":bayesian_information_criterion can be "justified":justifying_aic_and_bic in terms of the Laplace approximation.
* Some other ways to approximate the model evidence include:
** "variational Bayes":variational_bayes
** "MCMC":mcmc_partition_function
* The Laplace approximation approximates the posterior with a Gaussian. Other Gaussian approximations are more accurate, though often slower and more complicated to implement:
** "expectation propagation":expectation_propagation
** "Gaussian lower bound to the logistic function":variational_logistic_regression
