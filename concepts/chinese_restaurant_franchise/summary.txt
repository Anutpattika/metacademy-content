The Chinese Restaurant Franchise (CRF) is the predictive process for a hierarchical partitioning (clustering) of grouped data -- it is a generalization of the Chinese Restaurant Process. The CRF can be used to specify a nonparametric distribution on a mixture of mixtures: each grouping of data is a draw from a mixture model, where the mixture components are shared among different groups.
