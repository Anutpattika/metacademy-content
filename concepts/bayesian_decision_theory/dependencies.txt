tag: bayesian-parameter-estimation
reason: We use Bayesian parameter estimation to get the posterior on which we base our decisions.

tag: expectation_and_variance
reason: The goal of Bayesian decision theory is to minimize expected loss under the posterior.

tag: loss_function
reason: The goal of Bayesian decision theory is to minimize the expected loss under the posterior for a particular loss function.
