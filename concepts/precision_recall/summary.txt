In pattern recognition and information retrieval, precision (also called positive predictive value) is the fraction of retrieved instances that are relevant (Wikipedia). For instance, if an information retrieval system returned 20 documents, and 6 of the documents were relevant, the precision would be 6/20 = 0.3. On the other hand, recall (also called sensitivity) is the fraction of relevant instances that are retrieved (Wikipedia). For instance, if a corpus had 10 relevant documents in it and a information retrieval system returned 4 of those documents, the recall would be 4/10 = 0.4.
