tag: countable_sets
reason: Cardinality generalizes the notion of countable and uncoutable sets.

tag: equivalence_relations
reason: Cardinality is defined in terms of equinumerosity, an equivalence relation.

tag: order_relations
reason: One must show that the dominance relation is a total ordering.

tag: set_operations
reason: Sets of different cardinalities are constructed using various set operations.

tag: natural_numbers_as_sets
reason: Defining cardinality for finite sets requires viewing natural numbers as sets.
