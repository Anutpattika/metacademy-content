* Some reasons that the multivariate Gaussian distribution is often seen in nature:
** the "central limit theorem":central_limit_theorem says that sums of large numbers of independent random variables are approximately Gaussian
** the variance of many statistical estimators "approaches a Gaussian":asymptotics_of_maximum_likelihood as more data points are observed
* Multivariate Gaussians are popular in computer science because they give "efficient ways":computations_on_multivariate_gaussians to reason about dependencies between random variables.
* The parameters of a multivariate Gaussian can be estimated from data using:
** "maximum likelihood":maximum_likelihood_multivariate_gaussian
** "Bayesian parameter estimation":bayes_param_multivariate_gaussian
* Some statistical models which use multivariate Gaussians:
** "mixture of Gaussians":mixture_of_gaussians models, which are used to cluster data points
** "Bayesian linear regression":bayesian_linear_regression
** "linear dynamical systems":linear_dynamical_systems, which model how a system changes over time
* Multivariate Gaussians are an "exponential family":exponential_families distribution.
