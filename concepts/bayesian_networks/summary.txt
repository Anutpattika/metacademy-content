Bayesian networks are a graphical formalism for representing the structure of a probabilistic model, i.e. the ways in which the random variables may depend on each other. Intuitively, they are good at representing domains with a causal structure, and the edges in the graph determine which variables directly influence which other variables. They can be equivalently viewed as representing a factorization structure of the joint probability distribution, or as encoding a set of conditional independence assumptions about the distribution.
