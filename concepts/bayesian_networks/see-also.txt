* Bayes nets are closely related to "Markov random fields (MRFs)":markov_random_fields, a graphical model formalism which is good at representing soft constraints between variables.
* Neither Bayes nets nor MRFs are "strictly more powerful":bayes_nets_vs_mrfs_representation than the other.
* Bayes nets can also be characterized in terms of their conditional independencies. The conditional independencies can be found using "d-separation":d_separation.
* Often we are interested in
** "inferring the conditional probabilities":bayes_net_inference of some variables given others
** "learning the parameters of the network":bayes_net_parameter_learning from data
* The Bayes net representation assumes all the relevant information about the problem is contained in the joint distribution over all the variables. "Causal networks":causal_networks are a closely related formalism which captures more details about the causal relationships.
