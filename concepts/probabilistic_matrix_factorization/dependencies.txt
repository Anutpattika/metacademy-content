tag: bayesian-parameter-estimation
reason: PMF is a Bayesian model in which we need to estimate parameters.

tag: probabilistic-pca
reason: PMF can be seen as a Bayesian version of probabilistic PCA.

tag: gibbs-sampling
reason: We can sample the parameters using Gibbs sampling.

tag: computations-on-multivariate-gaussians
reason: PMF is motivated by only needing to perform linear algebraic operations on small matrices.
