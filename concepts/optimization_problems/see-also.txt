* "Lagrange multipliers":lagrange_multipliers can be used to solve optimization problems with equality or inequality constraints.
* Some examples of optimization problems:
** Fitting parameters of a statistical model using "maximum likelihood":maximum_likelihood
** "Linear least squares":linear_least_squares
* "Convex optimization problems":convex_optimization are a very broad class of optimization problems for which we can often find a global optimimum.
