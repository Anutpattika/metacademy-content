The Dirichlet distribution specifies a distribution on a n-dimensional vector and can be viewed as a probability distribution on a n-1 dimensional simplex (a simplex is an n-dimensional generalization of a triangle). Its parameters determine the distribution of mass on this simplex. The Dirichlet distribution is a conjugate prior to the categorigal and multinomial distributions, and for this reason, it is common in Bayesian statistics. Also, the Dirichlet distribution is a generalization of the beta distribution to higher dimensions (for n=2 it is the beta distribution).
