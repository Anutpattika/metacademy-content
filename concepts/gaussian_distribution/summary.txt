The Gaussian (or normal) distribution has a bell shape, and is one of the most common in all of statistics. The Central Limit Theorem shows that sums of large numbers of independent, identically distributed random variables are well approximated by a Gaussian distribution. The parameter estimates in a statistical model are also asymptotically Gaussian. Gaussians are widely used in probabilistic modeling for these reasons, together with the fact that Gaussian distributions can be efficiently manipulated using the techniques of linear algebra.
