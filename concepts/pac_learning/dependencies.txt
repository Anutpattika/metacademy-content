reason: PAC learning is a way of analyzing the generalization performance of learning algorithms.

tag: union_bound
reason: The union bound is an important tool for analyzing PAC learning.

tag: independent_events
reason: The analysis assumes that the training examples are independent draws from the distribution.

tag: chernoff_bounds
reason: The Chernoff bounds are an important tool for analyzing PAC learning.
