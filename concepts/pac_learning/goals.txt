* Know what it means for a hypothesis class to be PAC-learnable.
* Derive the bound on the probability of having generalization error greater than epsilon, in terms of the number of training examples and the size of the hypothesis class.
** Try rearranging the terms of the formula to view each variable as a function of the others. E.g., how many training examples do you need in order to guarantee a certain generalization accuracy?
* Carry out the analysis for a particular hypothesis class, such as boolean functions.
* Try to get a sense for how large hypothesis spaces are. E.g., what is the size of the hypothesis space for:
** classifying based on a single Boolean variable (from a set of D)
** all possible functions of D Boolean variables
