* The "Occam learning":occam_learning formalism justifies why simple classifiers should be expected to perform well.
* "VC dimension":vc_dimension is a measure of complexity which allows these results to be generalized to continuous hypothesis spaces.
* Some examples of PAC learning:
** "graphical model structures":pac_graphical_model_structures
** "finite state machines":pac_finite_state_machines
* "PAC-Bayesian analysis":pac_bayes allows us to derive PAC-style bounds for Bayesian classifiers
