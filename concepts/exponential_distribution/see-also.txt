* The "gamma distribution":gamma_distribution is a generalization of the exponential distribution.
* The "geometric distribution":geometric_distribution is a geometric analogue of the exponential distribution.
* The exponential distribution is the only "memoryless":memorylessness continuous distribution. 
* Equivalently, it is the only continuous distribution with constant "failure rate":failure_rate.
