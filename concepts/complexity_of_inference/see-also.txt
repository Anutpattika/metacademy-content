* When exact inference is infeasible, we must resort to approximate inference algorithms, such as:
** "loopy belief propagation":loopy_belief_propagation, which applies the BP update rules on non-tree graphs
** "Markov chain Monte Carlo":markov_chain_monte_carlo, a sampling-based method
** "variational inference":variational_inference, which tries to find a tractable approximation to the posterior
