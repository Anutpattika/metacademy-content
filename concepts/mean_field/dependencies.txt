tag: variational_inference
reason: Mean field is an instance of variational inference.

tag: independent_random_variables
reason: Mean field makes the approximation that certain random variables, or sets of random variables, are independent.

tag: lagrange_multipliers
reason: Lagrange multipliers are used to derive the mean field updates.
