* Know the definition of a sufficient statistic
* Derive an equivalent criterion in terms of a factorization of the distribution
* Prove the Rao-Blackwell Theorem, which implies that estimators should be based on sufficient statistics when the exist.
** Note: the general form of the Rao-Blackwell Theorem, which applies to convex loss functions, depends on "Jensen's inequality":jensens_inequality, but many texts give the special case for squared error.
