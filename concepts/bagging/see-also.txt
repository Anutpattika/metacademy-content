* "Random forests":random_forests often achieve much better performance by introducing additional randomness.
* "Boosting":boosting_vs_bagging is another classifier combination method which sounds similar to bagging, but is meant to improve accuracy rather than reduce variance.
* The "bootstrap":bootstrap is another technique based on randomly resampling a dataset.
