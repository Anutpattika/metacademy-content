* RBMs can be stacked to build deeper generative models, such as
** "deep belief networks":deep_belief_networks
** "deep Boltzmann machines":deep_boltzmann_machines
* RBMs are often used in "unsupervised pre-training":unsupervised_pre_training, where one initializes a discriminative model from a generative one.
* "Persistent contrastive divergence":persistent_contrastive_divergence is a variant on CD which tends to learn better generative models.
* "Hopfield networks":hopfield_networks are a classic neural net model of associative memory closely related to RBMs.
