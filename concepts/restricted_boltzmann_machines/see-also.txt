* RBMs can be stacked to build deeper generative models, such as
** "deep belief networks":deep_belief_networks
** "deep Boltzmann machines":deep_boltzmann_machines
* RBMs are often used in "generative pre-training":generative_pre_training, where one initializes a discriminative model from a generative one.
* "Persistent contrastive divergence":persistent_contrastive_divergence is a variant on CD which tends to learn better generative models.
