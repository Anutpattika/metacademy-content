Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) are a type of undirected graphical model typically used for learning binary feature representations. The structure consists of a bipartite graph with a layer of visible units to represent the inputs and a layer of hidden units to represent more abstract features. Training is intractable, but approximations such as contrastive divergence work well in practice. RBMs are a building block of many models in deep learning.
