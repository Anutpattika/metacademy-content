Tarski's Theorem states that no first-order logical theory has a predicate defining the Godel numbers of statements which are true of the natural numbers. In other words, a first-order theory which includes arithmetic can't define its own truth predicate. This is a fundamental limitation on mathematics, because it implies no formal system is powerful enough to define its own semantics.
