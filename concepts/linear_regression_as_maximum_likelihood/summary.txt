One way to solve a standard linear regression problem, y=w*x, is to assume the likelihood of the observed y, p(y; w*x, sigma^2) is Gaussian. This assumption means that we believe the observed values of y are a deterministic function of w*x plus some random Gaussian noise: y = w*x + e, where e is random Gaussian noise. If we assume a known sigma, the maximum likelihood estimator for w is obtained by minimizing the sum-of-squares error, Sum[(y-w*x)^2] for all y and x pairs, which has a closed form solution.
