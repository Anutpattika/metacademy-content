* Know the steps the AIS algorithm.
* Know how to obtain weighted samples and estimates of the partition function from the algorithm's outputs.
* Show that the variance of the weights approaches zero in the limit of infinitely many intermediate distributions (assuming the transition operator returns perfect samples).
