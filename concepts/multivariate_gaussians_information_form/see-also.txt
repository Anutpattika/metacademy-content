* Many "computations on multivariate Gaussians":computations_on_multivariate_gaussians are more efficient in information form.
* We saw we can represent multivariate Gaussians in covariance form or information form. These dual representations apply to "exponential families":exponential_families more generally.
* "Gaussian Markov random fields":gaussian_mrfs are a kind of graphical model which captures sparsity in the information form representation.
