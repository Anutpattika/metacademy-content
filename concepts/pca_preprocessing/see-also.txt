* Some other ways of reducing dimensionality:
** "Random projections":johnson_lindenstrauss, which can be simpler and faster.
** "Neural nets":feed_forward_neural_nets, which can adapt the representation as learning progresses, rather than fixing it at the start
* Often we would rather "learn overcomplete representations":learning_overcomplete_representations, which map the inputs to a higher dimensional space with more structure.
