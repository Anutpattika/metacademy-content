* Some common applications of HMMs:
** "speech recognition":hmms_in_speech
** "tracking objects":hmms_for_tracking
* "Hidden semi-Markov models":hidden_semi_markov_models are an elaboration of HMMs which explicitly model the duration distribution of each state
* We can perform exact inference efficiently in an HMM using the "forward-backward algorithm":forward_backward_algorithm.
* We can learn the parameters of an HMM using the "Baum-Welch algorithm":baum_welch_algorithm.
* HMMs can be seen as a kind of "Bayesian network":hmms_as_bayes_nets.
* "Dynamic Bayes nets":dynamic_bayes_nets are a kind of time series model which has multiple variables at each time step which influence each other
* The "particle filter":particle_filter is a way of performing inference in HMMs when the state space is too large to represent exactly.
* "Kalman filters":kalman_filter are a widely used special case of HMMs where all of the variables are Gaussian.
