* Neural nets are a form of "distributed representation":distributed_representations.
* Neural nets can be trained using an algorithm called "backpropagation":backpropagation.
* Some examples of neural net architectures:
** "convolutional nets":convolutional_nets, an architecture for vision problems where the weights are replicated across an image
** "Boltzmann machines":boltzmann_machines, a kind of neural net used for density modeling
** "deep belief nets":deep_belief_nets, which are used for learning multilayer representations
** "recurrent neural nets":recurrent_neural_nets, which implement a form of memory over time
* The field of "deep learning":deep_learning studies how to automatically construct features using deep neural nets.
* "Connectionist psychology":connectionist_psychology uses neural nets to model human cognition.
* We can theoretically analyze the "representational capacity of neural nets":representational_capacity_of_neural_nets.
