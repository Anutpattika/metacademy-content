* How can you set the weights of a single sigmoid unit in order to represent:
** the AND of two binary inputs
** the OR of two binary inputs
** a step function of one input x, where the step is at x=1
* How can you set the weights of a network with one hidden layer in order to represent the XOR of two binary inputs?
* Show that a single sigmoid unit can't represent XOR.
