* We can't always find a closed form solution to an optimization problem. Here are some computational techniques we can use:
** "projected gradient descent":projected_gradient_descent
** "interior point methods":interior_point_methods
* Some widely used classes of optimization problems:
** "convex optimization problems":convex_optimization
** "linear least squares":linear_least_squares
** "linear programs":linear_programs
** "quadratic programs":quadratic_programs
** "second-order conic programs":second_order_conic_programs
** "semidefinite programs":semidefinite_programs
