The support vector machine (SVM) is a classification algorithm which tries to fit a hyperplane which maximizes the margin, or the smallest distance separating an example from the decision boundary. The main advantage is that SVMs can be kernelized, allowing them to represent complex nonlinear decision boundaries. Conveniently, the kernelized representation only requires explicitly computing kernels with a small fraction of the data points.
