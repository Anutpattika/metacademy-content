* "Ridge regression":ridge_regression is another regularized version of linear regression, using an L2 penalty instead of L1. 
* The LASSO encourages sparsity of the weight vector. If we believe certain features are likely to be important as a group, we can use "group sparsity":group_sparsity instead.
* Some algorithms for optimizing the LASSO objective include:
** "stochastic gradient descent":stochastic_gradient_descent
** "least angle regression (LARS)":lars
** "Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA)":fista
* Other uses of L1 regularization include:
** "sparse coding for learning representations":sparse_coding
** "learning sparse undirected graphical models":learning_sparse_undirected_models
** "compressed sensing":compressed_sensing
