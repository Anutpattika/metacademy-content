* Common operations on matrices include:
** "matrix inverse":matrix_inverse, which is useful for "solving systems of linear equations":linear_systems_as_matrices
** "eigenvalues":eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors, a central concept in many areas of science and engineering 
** the "singular value decomposition":singular_value_decomposition, a canonical representation of matrices closely related to eigenvalues 
* Many properties of matrix multiplication can be generalized to "linear operators on vector spaces":linear_operators.
