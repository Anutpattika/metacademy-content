* Some examples of EM:
** "Gaussian mixture models":em_gaussian_mixtures
** "Factor analysis":em_factor_analysis
** "Baum-Welch algorithm":baum_welch_algorithm for learning hidden Markov models
* Some theoretical justifications of EM:
** Each step can be shown to "increase the model likelihood":em_analysis.
** EM can be viewed as "coordinate ascent on a lower bound of the data likelihood":em_variational_interpretation.
