* Know the definitions of covariance and correlation
* Write the covariance in terms of the moments of the distribution
* Know the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality for covariance (which bounds the covariance in terms of the individual variances)
* Be able to compute the variance of a linear combination of random variables in terms of their variances and covariances
* Know that independent random variables have zero covariance
* Show that variance of a sum of independent random variables is a sum of the variances
