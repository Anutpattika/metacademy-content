Suppose we observe a set of draws from a multinomial distribution with unknown parameters and we're trying to predict the distribution over subsequent draws. If we put a Dirichlet prior over the probabilities, we can analytically integrate out the parameters to get the posterior predictive distribution. This has a very simple form: adding fake counts and then normalizing. These ideas are used more generally in Bayesian models involving discrete variables.
