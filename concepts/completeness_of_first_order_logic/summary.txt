Godel's Completeness Theorem shows that there is a complete (and sound) deductive calculus for first-order logic. In other words, if some set of sentences is consistent (one cannot derive a contradiction from them), then there is some model in which all the sentences are satisfied. This result is significant in that it unifies the syntax and semantics of first-order logic.
