* Central linear algebra concepts which build directly on vectors include:
** "the dot product":dot_product
** "matrices":matrix_multiplication
** "vector norms":vector_norms
* Using a small set of axioms, the basic properties of vectors can be generalized to other "vector spaces":vector_spaces; examples include functions and polynomials.
