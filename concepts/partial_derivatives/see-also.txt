* "Higher order partial derivatives":higher_order_partial_derivatives
* Partial derivatives can be used to compute:
** the "gradient":gradient, an operator which "points uphill" 
** "directional derivatives":directional_derivatives, which compute the rate of change with respect to movement in a particular direction
