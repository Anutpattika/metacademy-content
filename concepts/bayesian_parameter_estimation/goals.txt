* Know what the terms "prior" and "likelihood function" refer to
* Be able to compute the posterior distribution using Bayes' Rule
* Know what the posterior predictive distribution is and how to compute it analytically for a simple example (e.g. a beta-Bernoulli model)
* What is a conjugate prior, and why is it useful?
* Why can the posterior distribution be given in terms of pseudocounts when a conjugate prior is used?
* What is the maximum a-posteriori (MAP) approximation?  Give an example where the predictions differ between the MAP parameters and the posterior predictive distribution.
