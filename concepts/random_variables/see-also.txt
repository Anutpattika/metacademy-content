* Some important properties of random variables:
** "expected value":expectation_and_variance, the value it takes "on average"
** "independence":independent_random_variables, i.e. one variable's distribution not depending on the other
** "variance":expectation_and_variance, how much the value tends to deviate from the mean
** "entropy":entropy, a measure of the amount of uncertainty
* Some distributions of interest:
** the "binomial distribution":binomial_distribution, which counts the number of times an event occurs between identical and independent trials
** the "multinomial distribution":multinomial_distribution, where it takes values from a discrete set, each with some probability
** the "Poisson distribution":poisson_distribution, used for modeling numbers of events that happen independently, such as earthquakes
** the "exponential distribution":exponential_distribution
** the "Gaussian distribution":gaussian_distribution, a "bell curve" which appears extremely frequently in nature and is widely used in statistical modeling
