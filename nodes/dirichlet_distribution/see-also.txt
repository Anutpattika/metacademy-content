* Mathematical tricks for manipulating Dirichlet distributions [dirichlet-tricks]
* We can define the Dirichlet distribution in terms of the gamma distribution. [dirichlet-from-gamma]
* The Dirichlet process is a generalization of the Dirichlet distribution to possibly infinite spaces, and is useful in mixture modeling. [dirichlet-process]
* The Dirichlet distribution is a conjugate prior to the categorical and multinomial distribution [conjugate-prior].
