* We can define the Dirichlet distribution in terms of the "gamma distribution":gamma_distribution.
* The "Dirichlet process":dirichlet_process is a generalization of the Dirichlet distribution to possibly infinite spaces, and is useful in mixture modeling.
* The Dirichlet distribution is a "conjugate prior":bayesian_parameter_estimation to the categorical and multinomial distribution.
