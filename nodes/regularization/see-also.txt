* Common regularizers include:
** "L_1 regularization":l1_regularization, which encourages sparsity
** "L_2 regularization":l2_regularization, which shrinks the coefficients towards zero
** "group sparsity":group_sparsity, where multiple coefficients are encouraged to be zero or nonzero together
** "Tikhonov regularization":tikhonov_regularization, which penalizes the sensitivity of the model's outputs to noises in the inputs
* The "trace norm":trace_norm_regularization is a regularizer for matrices which has been used in the Netflix competition.
* Regularization can equivalently be viewed as adding constraints to a model, a view taken in "structural risk minimization":structural_risk_minimization
