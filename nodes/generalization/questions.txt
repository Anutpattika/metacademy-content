* What is meant by overfitting and underfitting?  Generalization error?
* Have an intuitive example in mind (such as polynomial regression).
* Assuming you have enough data, how would you measure the generalization error of a model?
* Draw a curve representing the training and test set performances as a function of the number of training examples and explain why the curves have the shapes they do.
