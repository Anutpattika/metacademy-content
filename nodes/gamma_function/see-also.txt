* The gamma function can be approximated with Stirling's formula. [stirlings-formula]
* The gamma function features centrally in the Riemann hypothesis. [riemann-hypothesis]
* The gamma function is needed to define several probability distributions:
** gamma distribution [gamma-distribution]
** beta distribution [beta-distribution]
** Dirichlet distribution [dirichlet-distribution]
* The gamma function is an example of an analytic function. [analytic-functions]
