* From a Bayesian standpoint, it's better to average predictions over many models than to select just one. This is known as Bayesian model averaging. [bayesian-model-averaging]
* Some general classes of methods for estimating Bayes factors include:
** sequential Monte Carlo [smc-partition-function]
** Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) [mcmc-partition-function]
** variational Bayes [variational-bayes]
