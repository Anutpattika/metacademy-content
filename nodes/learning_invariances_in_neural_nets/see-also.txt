* Some particular strategies for learning invariances:
** building it explicitly into the architecture, as in "convolutional nets":convolutional_nets
** "augmenting the training set":augmenting_training_set_warped with warped examples
** "tangent propagation":tangent_propagation, which penalizes instability with respect to transformations
** "Tikhonov regularization":tikhonov_regularization, which penalizes instability with respect to noise
* "Learning invariances":representation_learning_invariances is a major goal in the field of representation learning.
* The representations in the human visual system are also "invariant":invariances_in_visual_system to various transformations.
