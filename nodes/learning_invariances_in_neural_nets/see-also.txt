* Some particular strategies for learning invariances:
** building it explicitly into the architecture, as in convolutional nets [convolutional-nets]
** augmenting the training set with warped examples [augmenting-training-set-warped]
** tangent propagation, which penalizes instability with respect to transformations [tangent-propagation]
** Tikhonov regularization, which penalizes instability with respect to noise [tikhonov-regularization]
* Learning invariances is a major goal in the field of representation learning. [representation-learning-invariances]
* The representations in the human visual system are also invariant to various transformations. [invariances-in-visual-system]
