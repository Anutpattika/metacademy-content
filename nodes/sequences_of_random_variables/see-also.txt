** "martingales":martingales, where the expected value at each time equals the previous value
** "Markov chains":markov_chains, where the distribution at each step depends only on the previous value
* Some important results about sequences of i.i.d. random variables:
** "weak law of large numbers":weak_law_of_large_numbers
