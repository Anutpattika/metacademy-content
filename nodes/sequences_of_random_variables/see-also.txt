* Some important kinds of sequences of random variables:
** martingales, where the expected value at each time equals the previous value [martingales]
** Markov chains, where the distribution at each step depends only on the previous value [markov-chains]
* Some important results about sequences of i.i.d. random variables:
** weak law of large numbers [weak-law-of-large-numbers]
** strong law of large numbers [strong-law-of-large-numbers]
** central limit theorem [central-limit-theorem]
