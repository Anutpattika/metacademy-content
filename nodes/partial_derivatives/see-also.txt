* Higher order partial derivatives [higher-order-partial-derivatives]
* Partial derivatives can be used to compute:
** the gradient, an operator which "points uphill" [gradient]
** directional derivatives, which compute the rate of change with respect to movement in a particular direction [directional-derivatives]
