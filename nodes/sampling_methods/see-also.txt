* Some commonly used sampling algorithms include:
** Gibbs sampling, a generic and widely applicable sampling algorithm [gibbs-sampling]
** particle filters, which are useful for time series modeling [particle-filter]
** Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, which is very general [metropolis-hastings]
* Two general classes of sampling algorithms include:
** Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) [markov-chain-monte-carlo]
** sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) [sequential-monte-carlo]
* Some example uses of sampling algorithms:
** estimating the partition function [sampling-partition-function]
* Other general classes of approximate inference techniques include:
** variational inference, which tries to approximate an intractable posterior distribution with a tractable one [variational-inference]
** loopy belief propagation, a strategy which is particular to graphical models [loopy-belief-propagation]
