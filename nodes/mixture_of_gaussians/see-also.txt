* "K-means":k_means is a simpler clustering model which is faster to fit and often used as an initialization.
* When there isn't enough data to fit a general mixture of Gaussians, here are some alternative models:
** "Bayesian mixture of Gaussians":bayesian_mixture_of_gaussians
** "mixture of factor analyzers":mixture_of_factor_analyzers
** "co-clustering":co_clustering
** "Bayesian clustered tensor factorization":bayesian_clustered_tensor_factorization
* When the clusters aren't likely to be shaped like Gaussians, consider these clustering models:
** "spectral clustering":spectral_clustering
** "mean-shift":mean_shift
* "Chinese restaurant processes":crp_clustering let us fit a mixture of Gaussians when the number of components isn't known in advance.
