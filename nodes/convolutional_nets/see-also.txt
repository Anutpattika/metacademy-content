* Convolutional nets are one way to get invariances in a neural net representation. Other ways include:
** augmenting the training set with warped examples [augmenting-training-set-warped]
** tangent propagation, which penalizes instability with respect to transformations [tangent-propagation]
** Tikhonov regularization, which penalizes instability with respect to noise [tikhonov-regularization]
* Learning invariances is a major goal in the field of representation learning. [representation-learning-invariances]
* Convolutional neural nets learn oriented filters similar to the receptive fields in the human primary visual cortex. [representations-in-v1]
