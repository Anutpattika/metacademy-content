* Other methods for projecting data onto a low-dimensional subspace include:
** "principal component analysis (PCA)":principal_component_analysis
** "factor analysis":factor_analysis
* Often we can get a better visualization of the data using a nonlinear embedding. Some methods for doing this include:
** "multidimensional scaling (MDS)":multidimensional_scaling
** "Isomap":isomap
** "locally linear embedding":locally_linear_embedding
** "stochastic neighbor embedding":stochastic_neighbor_embedding
* If the goal is classification rather than visualization, consider some other algorithms more directly geared towards the task:
** "multiway logistic regression":multiway_logistic_regression
** "multiclass support vector machines (SVMs)":multiclass_svms
