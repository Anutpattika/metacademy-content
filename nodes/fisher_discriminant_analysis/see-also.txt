* Other methods for projecting data onto a low-dimensional subspace include:
** principal component analysis (PCA) [principal-component-analysis]
** factor analysis [factor-analysis]
* Often we can get a better visualization of the data using a nonlinear embedding. Some methods for doing this include:
** multidimensional scaling (MDS) [multidimensional-scaling]
** Isomap [isomap]
** locally linear embedding [locally-linear-embedding]
** stochastic neighbor embedding [stochastic-neighbor-embedding]
* If the goal is classification rather than visualization, consider some other algorithms more directly geared towards the task:
** multiway logistic regression [multiway-logistic-regression]
** multiclass support vector machines (SVMs) [multiclass-svms]
