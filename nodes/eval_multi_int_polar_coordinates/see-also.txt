* This trick can be generalized to three dimensions:
** spherical coordinates [eval-multi-int-spherical-coordinates]
** cylindrical coordinates [eval-multi-int-cylindrical-coordinates]
* This trick is an instance of the more general notion of change of variables. [eval-multi-int-change-of-variables]
