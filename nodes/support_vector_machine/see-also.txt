* If the training set is not linearly separable, the "soft-margin SVM":soft_margin_svm allows for some of the constraints to be violated.XS
* The SVM can be optimized with the "sequential minimal optimization (SMO)":sequential_minimal_optimization algorithm.
* The main advantage of SVMs is that they can be "kernelized":kernel_svm in order to capture nonlinear dependencies.
* The SVM is "closely related":svm_vs_logistic_regression to "logistic regression":logistic_regression, and it is instructive to compare the loss functions.
* The SVM "can be justified":statistical_learning_theory_for_svm as optimizing a tradeoff between bias and variance.
