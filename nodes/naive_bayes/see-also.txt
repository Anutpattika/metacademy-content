* Naive Bayes is a "generative model":generative_vs_discriminative.
* Rather than performing a maximum likelihood estimation of the Naive Bayes model, we can "use Bayesian inference":bayesian_naive_bayes to obtain posterior beliefs for the classes given the observed data.
* Here are some other commonly used classification algorithms:
** "perceptron":perceptron
** "logistic regression":logistic_regression
** "support vector machines (SVMs)":support_vector_machines
** "Gaussian discriminant analysis":gaussian_discriminant_analysis
