* Naive Bayes is a generative model. [generative-vs-discriminative]
* Rather than performing a maximum likelihood estimation of the Naive Bayes model, we can use Bayesian inference to obtain posterior beliefs for the classes given the observed data. [bayesian-naive-bayes]
* Here are some other commonly used classification algorithms:
** perceptron [perceptron]
** logistic regression [logistic-regression]
** support vector machines (SVMs) [support-vector-machines]
** Gaussian discriminant analysis [gaussian-discriminant-analysis]
