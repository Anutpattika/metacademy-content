* The eigenvalues of a symmetric PSD matrix are closely related to the "singular value decomposition":singular_value_decomposition
* Some common examples of PSD matrices:
** "covariance matrices":covariance_matrices, which represent dependencies between different random variables
** "kernel matrices":kernel_trick, a way of representing similarity in machine learning
* "Semidefinite programming":semidefinite_programming is a very general category of convex optimization problem.
