A symmetric matrix A is positive definite if x^T A x > 0 for any nonzero vector x, or positive semidefinite if the inequality is not necessarily strict. They can be equivalently characterized in terms of all of the eigenvalues being positive, or all of the pivots in Gaussian elimination being positive. Examples of PSD matrices include covariance matrices and Hessian matrices of convex functions. The singular value decomposition (SVD) is closely related to the eigendecomposition of a positive semidefinite matrix.
