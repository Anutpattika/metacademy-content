* Some probabilistic models allow for more efficient conditioning by exploiting problem structure:
** Gaussian Markov random fields, which exploit sparsity in the precision matrix [gaussian-markov-random-fields]
** Linear-Gaussian models, which exploit sparsity in the Cholesky decomposition [linear-gaussian-models]
