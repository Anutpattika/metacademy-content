* The evidence approximation requires integrating out the model parameters. Variational Bayes gives a way of doing this. [variational-bayes]
* An alternative to the evidence approximation is to define a prior over the hyperparameters and integrate them out. This is an instance of hierarchical Bayesian modeling. [hierarchical-bayesian-modeling]
* The evidence approximation can be computed exactly in the case of Gaussian processes. [evidence-approximation-gaussian-processes]
