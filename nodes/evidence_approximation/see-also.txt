* The evidence approximation requires integrating out the model parameters. "Variational Bayes":variational_bayes gives a way of doing this.
* An alternative to the evidence approximation is to define a prior over the hyperparameters and integrate them out. This is an instance of "hierarchical Bayesian modeling":hierarchical_bayesian_modeling.
* The evidence approximation "can be computed exactly":evidence_approximation_gaussian_processes in the case of Gaussian processes.
