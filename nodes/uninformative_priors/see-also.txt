* Jeffreys priors are a general way to construct uninformative priors. [jeffreys-priors]
* Weakly informative priors keep the flexibility of uninformative priors while avoiding the problems caused by improper priors. [weakly-informative-priors]
* Improper priors can't be used when computing model evidence in Bayesian model comparison. [improper-priors-and-model-evidence]
