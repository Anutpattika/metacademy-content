tag: linear_approximation
reason: The gradient gives another way to represent the linear approximation to a function.

tag: partial_derivatives
reason: The gradient is computed in terms of partial derivatives.

tag: dot_product
reason: The linear approximation is given in terms of a dot product with the gradient.
