* The gamma distribution is used to construct a prior for the scale parameters in Bayesian parameter estimation. [bayesian-parameter-estimation-gaussian]
* The gamma distribution is a member of the exponential family. [exponential-family]
* The Wishart distribution is a generalization of the gamma distribution to positive semidefinite matrices. [wishart-distribution]
* Some special cases of the gamma distribution:
** exponential distribution [exponential-distribution]
** chi-squared distribution [chi-squared-distribution]
* The student-t distribution is a heavy-tailed distribution constructed from the Gaussian distribution and gamma distribution. [stuent-t-distribution]
* Gamma distributions are used to model the intervals between neuronal firings. [neuronal-firings-gamma]
