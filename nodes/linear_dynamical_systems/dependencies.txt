tag: multivariate_gaussian_distribution
reason: Linear dynamical systems are defined in terms of multivariate Gaussians.

tag: conditional_distributions
reason: Linear dynamical systems are defined in terms of conditional distributions.

tag: conditional_independence
reason: We can characterize linear dynamical systems in terms of conditional independence properties.
