* Some uses of multiple integrals:
** Computing the probability that a continuous random variable takes a value in some set [random-variables]
* The Riemann integral formalizes these notions. [riemann-integral]
* Some tricks for evaluating multiple integrals:
** changing the order of integration [eval-multi-int-changing-order]
** change of variables [eval-multi-int-change-of-variables]
** polar coordinates [eval-multi-int-polar-coordinates]
** spherical coordinates [eval-multi-int-spherical-coordinates]
** cylindrical coordinates [eval-multi-int-cylindrical-coordinates]
* Measure theory offers a more general notion of integration. [measures]
