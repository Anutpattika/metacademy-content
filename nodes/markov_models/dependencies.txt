reason: Markov models are based on Markov chains.

tag: probabilistic-models
reason: Markov models are a kind of probabilistic model.

tag: matrix_multiplication
reason: Markov models can be conveniently represented using transition matrices.

tag: conditional_distributions
reason: Markov models are defined in terms of the transition distribution, which is a conditional distribution.
