tag: markov_chains
reason: Markov models are based on Markov chains.

tag: matrix_multiplication
reason: Markov models can be conveniently represented using transition matrices.

tag: conditional_distributions
reason: Markov models are defined in terms of the transition distribution, which is a conditional distribution.

tag: conditional_independence
reason: Markov models can be defined in terms of a conditional independence property.
