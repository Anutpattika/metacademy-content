tag: linear_systems_as_matrices
reason: Eigenvalues are defined as solutions to a system of linear equations.

tag: column_space_and_nullspace
reason: Eigenspaces can be viewed as nullspaces of a particular matrix.

tag: determinant
reason: The characteristic polynomial, used for computing eigenvalues analytically, is given in terms of a determinant.

tag: roots_of_polynomials
reason: The eigenvalues can be computed as roots of a polynomial.

tag: complex_numbers
reason: The eigenvalues and eigenvectors may be complex valued.
