* Some additional examples of conjugate priors:
** The Wishart distribution is the conjugate prior for the precision matrix of a multivariate Gaussian. [wishart-distribution]
** The Dirichlet distribution is the conjugate prior for the multinomial distribution. [dirichlet-distribution]
* Conjugate priors often have nice forms for exponential families. [bayes-param-exp-fam]
