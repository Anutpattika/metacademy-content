* Central linear algebra concepts which build directly on vectors include:
** the dot product [dot-product]
** matrices [matrices]
** vector norms [vector-norms]
* Using a small set of axioms, the basic properties of vectors can be generalized to other vector spaces; examples include functions and polynomials. [vector-spaces]
