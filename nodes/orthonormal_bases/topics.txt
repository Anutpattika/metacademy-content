* definitions of orthonormal basis and orthogonal matrix
* that the inverse of an orthogonal matrix is the transpose
* that the transpose of an orthogonal matrix is orthogonal
* using orthonormal bases for projection
* that orthogonal matrices preserve dot products (and therefore angles and Euclidean norms)
* finding orthonormal bases using Gram-Schmidt
