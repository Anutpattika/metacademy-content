* Common operations on matrices include:
** matrix inverse, which is useful for solving systems of linear equations [systems-of-linear-equations]
** eigenvalues, a central concept in many areas of science and engineering [eigenvalues]
** the singular value decomposition, a canonical representation of matrices closely related to eigenvalues [singular-value-decomposition]
* Many properties of matrix multiplication can be generalized to linear operators on vector spaces. [linear-operators]
