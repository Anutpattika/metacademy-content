* Another important notion of convexity is "convex functions":convex_functions.
* Convex sets are used to define "convex optimization problems":convex_optimization, a very general class of optimization problem.
* Some important examples of convex sets:
** "solution sets of linear systems":solution_sets_of_linear_systems
** "polytopes":representing_polytopes
** "positive semidefinite cone":positive_semidefinite_cone, a central object in semidefinite programming
