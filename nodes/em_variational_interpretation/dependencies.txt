tag: expectation-maximization

tag: maximum_likelihood
reason: We analyze EM as an algorithm for maximizing the likelihood.

tag: kl-divergence
reason: KL divergence is part of the objective function in variational EM.

tag: jensens_inequality
reason: Jensen's inequality is used to show that EM improves a lower bound on the likelihood.
