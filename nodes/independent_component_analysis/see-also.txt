* Some other techniques for learning meaningful representations of data:
** manifold learning, where we try to embed points in a low-dimensional space where similar points are close together [manifold-learning]
** sparse coding, a generative model similar to ICA, but which gives an overcomplete representation (i.e. larger than the input representation) [sparse-coding]
* ICA is often used for learning representations of:
** images [learning-representations-of-images]
** audio [learning-representations-of-audio]
* FastICA is an efficient algorithm for fitting ICA models. [fast-ica]
