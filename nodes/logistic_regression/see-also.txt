* Logistic regression is a discriminative model. [generative-vs-discriminative]
* Logistic regression is a kind of generalized linear model. [generalized-linear-models]
* Iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) is a faster method for fitting logistic regression in low-dimensional settings. [logistic-regression-irls]
* Probit regression is a related model which uses thresholded Gaussians for the observation model instead the logistic function. [probit-regression]
* We can formulate logistic regression as a Bayesian model to prevent overfitting and measure our confidence in the answer. [bayesian-logistic-regression]
* Here are some other commonly used binary classification algorithms:
** perceptron [perceptron]
** support vector machines (SVMs) [support-vector-machines]
** Gaussian discriminant analysis [gaussian-discriminant-analysis]
** naive Bayes [naive-bayes]
* We would like our classifier to generalize well to new data, not just the data it's already seen. [generalization]
* Some general techniques for improving generalization include:
** regularization, where overly complex solutions are penalized [regularization]
** model selection [model-selection]
** feature selection [feature-selection]
* Not all variables of interest can be modeled as linear functions of the input variables. To model nonlinear dependencies, check out:
** basis function expansions [basis-function-expansions]
** neural networks [feed-forward-neural-nets]
** kernel methods [kernel-svm]
