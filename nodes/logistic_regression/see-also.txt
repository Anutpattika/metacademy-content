* Logistic regression is a "discriminative model":generative_vs_discriminative.
* Logistic regression is a kind of "generalized linear model":generalized_linear_models.
* "Iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS)":logistic_regression_irls is a faster method for fitting logistic regression in low-dimensional settings.
* "Probit regression":probit_regression is a related model which uses thresholded Gaussians for the observation model instead the logistic function.
* We can "formulate logistic regression as a Bayesian model":bayesian_logistic_regression to prevent overfitting and measure our confidence in the answer.
* Here are some other commonly used binary classification algorithms:
** "perceptron":perceptron
** "support vector machines (SVMs)":support_vector_machines
** "Gaussian discriminant analysis":gaussian_discriminant_analysis
** "naive Bayes":naive_bayes
* We would like our classifier to "generalize well to new data":generalization, not just the data it's already seen.
* Some general techniques for improving generalization include:
** "regularization":regularization, where overly complex solutions are penalized
** "model selection":model_selection
** "feature selection":feature_selection
* Not all variables of interest can be modeled as linear functions of the input variables. To model nonlinear dependencies, check out:
** "basis function expansions":basis_function_expansions
** "neural networks":feed_forward_neural_nets
** "kernel methods":kernel_svm
