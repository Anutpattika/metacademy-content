* Generalized linear models are a generalization of linear regression where the observation model is an exponential family distribution. [generalized-linear-models]
* A lot of aspects of statistical modeling wind up having convenient forms for exponential families:
** conjugate priors [bayes-param-exp-fam]
** maximum likelihood estimation [maximum-likelihood-in-exponential-families]
** variational inference, a kind of approximate probabilistic inference algorithm [variational-exponential-family]
* Markov random fields can be viewed as exponential families. [mrfs-as-exponential-families]
