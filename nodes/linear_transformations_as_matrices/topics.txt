* definition of linear transformation
* why matrix vector products are linear
* how to recover the matrix for a linear transformation, in the standard basis for R^n
* linear combinations of linear transformations = linear combinations of matrices
* examples of transformations represented as matrices (e.g. reflection, rotation, scaling)
