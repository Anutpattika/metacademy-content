* Some examples of EM:
** Gaussian mixture models [em-gaussian-mixtures]
** Factor analysis [em-factor-analysis]
** Baum-Welch algorithm for learning hidden Markov models [baum-welch]
* Some theoretical justifications of EM:
** Each step can be shown to increase the likelihood of the data. [em-analysis]
** EM can be viewed as coordinate ascent on a lower bound of the data likelihood. [em-variational-interpretation]
