* Examples of maximum likelihood estimation include:
** Linear regression [linear-regression-as-maximum-likelihood]
** Logistic regression [logistic-regression]
** Mixture of Gaussians modeling [mixture-of-gaussians]
* Maximum likelihood enjoys several guarantees under very general conditions:
** consistency [consistency-of-maximum-likelihood]
** efficiency (in the statistical sense) [efficiency-of-maximum-likelihood]
* For many commonly used distributions, we can find the global optimum because the optimization problem is convex. [maximum-likelihood-and-convex-optimization]
* Maximum likelihood can be prone to overfitting when there is not enough data to estimate the parameters. [generalization]
* Some techniques for avoiding overfitting include:
** Regularized maximum likelihood [regularized-maximum-likelihood]
** Bayesian parameter estimation [bayesian-parameter-estimation]
** Model selection [model-selection]
** Feature selection [feature-selection]
** Early stopping [early-stopping]
* Some commonly used optimization algorithms for maximum likelihood estimation include:
** gradient descent [gradient-descent]
** expectation-maximization (EM) [expectation-maximization]
** second-order methods [second-order-optimization-methods]
* In exponential family models, maximum likelihood can be equivalently interpreted as maximum entropy modeling. [ml-as-maxent]
