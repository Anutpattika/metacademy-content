* "Mathematical derivation":kalman_filter_derivation of the Kalman filter
* The "Kalman smoother":kalman_smoother can be used to infer the posterior marginals over the whole sequence, not just the current state. 
* Kalman smoothing can be regarded as a "speical case":kalman_as_forward_backward of the "forward-backward algorithm":forward_backward_algorithm for HMMs.
