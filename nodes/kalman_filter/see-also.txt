* Mathematical derivation of the Kalman filter [kalman_filter_derivation]
* The Kalman smoother can be used to infer the posterior marginals over the whole sequence, not just the current state. [kalman_smoother]
* Kalman smoothing can be regarded as a speical case of the forward-backward algorithm for HMMs. [kalman_as_forward_backward]
