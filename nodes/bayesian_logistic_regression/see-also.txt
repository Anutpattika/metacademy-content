* Bayesian logistic regression is intractable to solve exactly. Some approximation methods include:
** Laplace approximation [laplace-approximation]
** variational Bayes [variational-logistic-regression]
** expectation propagation [ep-logistic-regression]
* Gaussian process regression is a nonlinear analogue. [gaussian-process-logistic-regression]
