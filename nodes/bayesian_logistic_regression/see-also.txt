* Bayesian logistic regression is intractable to solve exactly. Some approximation methods include:
** "Laplace approximation":laplace_approximation
** "variational Bayes":variational_logistic_regression
** "expectation propagation":ep_logistic_regression
* "Gaussian process classification":gaussian_process_classification is a nonlinear analogue.
