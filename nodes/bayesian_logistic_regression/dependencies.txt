tag: bayesian-linear-regression
reason: Many of the ideas from Bayesian linear regression transfer to Bayesian logistic regression.

tag: laplace-approximation
reason: The Laplace approximation is a simple way to approximate Bayesian logistic regression.

tag: evidence-approximation
reason: The evidence approximation is a simple way to choose hyperparameters in Bayesian logistic regression.

tag: bayesian-decision-theory
reason: Decision theory tells us how to make predictions from Bayesian parameter estimation.
 
tag: probit_regression
reason: The posterior predictive distribution is often approximated using probit regression.
