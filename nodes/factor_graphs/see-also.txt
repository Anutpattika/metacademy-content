* Sometimes factorization assumptions can be represented as "tree-structured factor graphs":factor_graph_trees when their Bayes net or MRF representations aren't tree-structured. Common examples include polytrees and chordal graphs.
* In such cases, "factor graph belief propagation":factor_graph_bp can be applied to perform exact inference.
