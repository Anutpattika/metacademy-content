* Some algorithms for inference in Gaussian MRFs:
** variable elimination [gaussian-variable-elimination]
** belief propagation [gaussian-bp-on-trees]
* Another way to perform efficient inference is to apply the naive formulas, but use sparse methods to solve the linear systems. [solving-sparse-linear-systems]
