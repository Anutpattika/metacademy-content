* Following on this result, the "Baum-Welch algorithm":baum_welch_algorithm for learning HMM parameters can be seen as a "speical case":baum_welch_as_em of "Expectation-Maximization":expectation_maximization.
* "Kalman smoothing":kalman_smoother can be seen as a "speical case":kalman_as_bp of the forward-backward algorithm, hence a special case of BP.
