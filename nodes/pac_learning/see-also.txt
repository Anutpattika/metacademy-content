* Proofs of the results presented here [pac-learning-proofs]
* The Occam learning formalism justifies why simple classifiers should be expected to perform well. [occam-learning]
* Statistical learning theory is a related formalism which can be used to analyze many commonly used learning algorithms. [statistical-learning-theory]
* Some examples of PAC learning:
** graphical model structures [pac-graphical-model-structures]
** finite state machines [pac-finite-state-machines]
* PAC-Bayesian analysis allows us to derive PAC-style bounds for Bayesian classifiers [pac-bayes]
