* If we run multiple queries, variable elimination involves redundant computations. "Belief propagation":gaussian_bp_on_trees gives a way of sharing these computations. 
* "Kalman smoothing":kalman_as_bp can be seen as a special case of Gaussian BP.
* "Gaussian variable elimination":gaussian_variable_elimination_as_gaussian_elimination is equivalent to Gaussian elimination.
