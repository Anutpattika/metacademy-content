tag: random_variables
reason: Multivariate distributions are a way of representing dependencies between random variables.

tag: multiple_integrals
reason: Multiple integrals are needed to compute probabilities associated with continuous multivariate distributions.

tag: cumulative_distribution_function
reason: Joint distributions can be represented in terms of the joint CDF.

tag: higher_order_partial_derivatives
reason: Higher order partial derivatives are used to recover the joint PDF from the joint CDF.
