* We can't always find a closed form solution to an optimization problem. Here are some computational techniques we can use:
** projected gradient descent [projected-gradient-descent]
** interior point methods [interior-point-methods]
* Some widely used classes of optimization problems:
** convex optimization problems [convex-optimization]
** linear least squares [linear-least-squares]
** linear programs [linear-programs]
** quadratic programs [quadratic-programs]
** second-order conic programs [second-order-conic-programs]
** semidefinite programs [semidefinite-programs]
