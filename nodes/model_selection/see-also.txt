* Another way to control model complexity is through feature selection. Similar issues are involved. [feature-selection]
* Common strategies for model selection include:
** Cross-validation, a simple technique applicable whenever we're interested in making predictions [cross-validation]
** Estimates of generalization error, such as:
*** the effective number of parameters (for linear regression) [effective-number-of-parameters]
*** the Akaike information criterion (for density estimation) [akaike-information-criterion]
** Criteria inspired by Bayesian arguments:
*** Bayesian model comparison [bayesian-model-comparison]
*** Bayesian model averaging [bayesian-model-averaging]
*** Bayesian information criterion (BIC) [bayesian-information-criterion]
* In general, the Bayesian criteria are more conservative than the predictive criteria, in terms of more strongly preferring simple models. Which one is preferable depends on your goals. [aic-vs-bic]
