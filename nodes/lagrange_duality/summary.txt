The Lagrange dual of a convex optimization problem is another convex optimization problem where the optimization variables are the Lagrange multipliers of the original problem. It leads to surprising relationships between seemingly different optimization problems. Duality is commonly used in approximation algorithms, since constraining the dual corresponds to relaxing the original problem.
