* Other ways to approximate partition functions include:
** sequential importance sampling (SIS) [sis-partition-function]
** variational Bayes [variational-bayes]
** expectation propagation [expectation-propagation]
** Chib's method [chibs-method]
** tree-reweighted belief propagation [tree-reweighted-bp]
