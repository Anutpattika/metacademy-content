tag: convex_sets
reason: The domain of a convex function must be a convex set.

tag: vectors
reason: Convex functions are defined in terms of vectors.

tag: linear_approximation
reason: The first-order condition for convexity is that the linear approximation lie below the function.

tag: gradient
reason: The first-order condition for convexity is that the linear approximation lie below the function.

tag: higher_order_partial_derivatives
reason: The second-order condition for convexity is that the second-derivative matrix be positive semidefinite.
