tag: multivariate-gaussian-distribution
reason: The maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters is approximately a multivariate Gaussian in the large data limit.

tag: fisher-information-matrix
reason: The asymptotic covariance of the maximum likelihood estimate is determined by the Fisher information matrix.
