tag: column_space_and_nullspace
reason: The column space and nullspace are two of the fundamental subspaces.

tag: subspaces
reason: The rank is defined in terms of the dimension of a certain subspace.

tag: bases
reason: Analyzing the dimensions of the subspaces requires determining bases for them.

tag: gaussian_elimination
reason: Gaussian elimination is used to compute bases for the subspaces.

tag: matrix_transpose
reason: Different subspaces are related by matrix transposes.
