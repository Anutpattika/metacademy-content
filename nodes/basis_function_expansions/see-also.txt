* Often basis function expansions do not give us enough flexibility to model the nonlinear structure we're interested in. More powerful methods include:
** "Neural networks":feed_forward_neural_nets, which allow the basis functions to be adapted to the data.
** "Kernels":kernel_ridge_regression, which a way of implicitly representing a very high-dimensional (possibly infinite dimensional) feature expansion in terms of a kernel function between data points
** "Representation learining":representation_learning, an area of machine learning which tries to learn high-level feature representations automatically from the raw data
