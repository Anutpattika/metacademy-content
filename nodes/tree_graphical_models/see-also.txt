* Trees are interesting because several important problems can be solved exactly, and efficiently:
** Conditional probability queries, using belief propagation [belief-propagation-on-trees]
** Parameter learning [tree-graph-parameter-learning]
** Learning the tree structure (i.e. Chow-Liu trees) [chow-liu-trees]
