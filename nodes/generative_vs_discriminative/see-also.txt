* The following are important examples of generative models:
** "naive Bayes":naive_bayes
** "Gaussian discriminant analysis":gaussian_discriminant_analysis
** "Bayesian networks (Bayes nets)":learning_bayes_net_parameters
** "Markov random fields (MRFs)":learning_mrf_parameters
* The following are important examples of discriminative models:
** "linear regression":linear_regression_as_maximum_likelihood
** "logistic regression":logistic_regression
** "feed-forward neural networks":feed_forward_neural_nets
** "Gaussian process regression":gaussian_process_regression
* Generative models are often used to "pre-train":generative_pre_training discriminative models in the field of deep learning.
* One advantage of generative modeling is that it makes it easier to "share structure between related problems":multitask_learning.
