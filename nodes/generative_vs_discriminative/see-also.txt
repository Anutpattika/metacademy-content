* The following are important examples of generative models:
** naive Bayes [naive-bayes]
** Gaussian discriminant analysis [gaussian-discriminant-analysis]
** Bayesian networks (Bayes nets) [learning-bayes-nets]
** Markov random fields (MRFs) [learning-mrfs]
* The following are important examples of discriminative models:
** linear regression [linear-regression-as-maximum-likelihood]
** logistic regression [logistic-regression]
** feed-forward neural networks [feed-forward-neural-nets]
** Gaussian process regression [gaussian-process-regression]
* Generative models are often used to "pre-train" discriminative models in the field of deep learning. [generative-pre-training]
* One advantage of generative modeling is that it makes it easier to share structure between related problems. [multitask-learning]
