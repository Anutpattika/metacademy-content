reason: The AIC and BIC are defined in terms of the effective number of parameters.

tag: bayesian-model-comparison
reason: The BIC is justified as an approximation to Bayesian model comparison.

tag: laplace-approximation
reason: The BIC is justified as an approximation to the Laplace approximation.
