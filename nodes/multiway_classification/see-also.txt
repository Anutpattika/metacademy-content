* Here are some commonly used multiway classification algorithms:
** "multinomial logistic regression":multinomial_logistic_regression
** "multiclass support vector machines (SVMs)":multiclass_svm
* Other kinds of targets include:
** "real-valued":linear_regression
** "binary":binary_linear_classifiers
** "ordinal":ordinal_regression (i.e. only the ranking matters)
* We want our classifier to "generalize well to new data":generalization, not just perform well on the data it's already seen.
* Some general techniques for improving generalization include:
** "regularization":regularization, where overly complex solutions are penalized
** "model selection":model_selection
** "feature selection":feature_selection
* Not all variables of interest can be modeled as linear functions of the input variables. To model nonlinear dependencies, check out:
** "basis function expansions":basis_function_expansions
** "neural networks":feed_forward_neural_nets
** "kernel methods":kernel_svm
