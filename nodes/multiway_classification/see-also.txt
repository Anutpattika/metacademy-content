* Here are some commonly used multiway classification algorithms:
** multinomial logistic regression [multinomial-logistic-regression]
** multiclass support vector machines (SVMs) [multiclass-svm]
* Other kinds of targets include:
** real-valued [linear-regression]
** binary [binary-linear-classifiers]
** ordinal (i.e. only the ranking matters) [ordinal-regression]
* We want our classifier to generalize well to new data, not just perform well on the data it's already seen. [generalization]
* Some general techniques for improving generalization include:
** regularization, where overly complex solutions are penalized [regularization]
** model selection [model-selection]
** feature selection [feature-selection]
* Not all variables of interest can be modeled as linear functions of the input variables. To model nonlinear dependencies, check out:
** basis function expansions [basis-function-expansions]
** neural networks [feed-forward-neural-nets]
** kernel methods [kernel-svm]
