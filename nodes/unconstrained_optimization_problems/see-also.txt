* Lagrange multipliers can be used to solve optimization problems with equality or inequality constraints. [lagrange-multipliers]
* Some examples of optimization problems:
** Fitting parameters of a statistical model using maximum likelihood [maximum-likelihood]
** Linear least squares [linear-least-squares]
* Convex optimization problems are a very broad class of optimization problems for which we can often find a global optimimum. [convex-optimization]
