Unconstrained optimization is the maximization or minimization of a function or functional without imposing constraints on the optimization results. Many regression and classification algorithms embed unconstrained optimization problems. Unconstrained optimization in machine learning is usually accomplished analytically (i.e. by setting the gradient equal to zero and solving the resulting equalities), iteratively (e.g. gradient-descent), or stochastically (e.g. via stochastic sampling approaches such as simulated annealing).
