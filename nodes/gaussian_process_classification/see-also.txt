* We can approximate the solution to GP classification using the Laplace approximation. [gp-classification-laplace]
* Gaussian processes have a variety of uses in machine learning, including:
** regression [gaussian-process-regression]
** black-box optimization (where we only get to evaluate the function, and doing so is expensive) [bayesian-optimization-with-gaussian-processes]
** reinforcement learning [gaussian-processes-for-reinforcement-learning]
* Techniques for constructing kernel functions [constructing-kernels]
