* We can approximate the solution to GP classification using the "Laplace approximation":gp_classification_laplace.
* Gaussian processes have a variety of uses in machine learning, including:
** "regression":gaussian_process_regression
** "black-box optimization":bayesian_optimization (where we only get to evaluate the function, and doing so is expensive)
** "reinforcement learning":gaussian_processes_for_reinforcement_learning
* Techniques for "constructing kernel functions":constructing_kernels
