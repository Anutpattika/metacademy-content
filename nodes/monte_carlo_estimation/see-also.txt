* Some commonly used sampling algorithms include:
** "Gibbs sampling":gibbs_sampling, a generic and widely applicable sampling algorithm
** "particle filters":particle_filter, which are useful for time series modeling 
** "Metropolis-Hastings algorithm":metropolis_hastings, which is very general
* Two general classes of sampling algorithms include:
** "Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)":markov_chain_monte_carlo
** "sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)":sequential_monte_carlo
* Some example uses of sampling algorithms:
** "estimating the partition function":sampling_partition_function
* Other general classes of approximate inference techniques include:
** "variational inference":variational_inference, which tries to approximate an intractable posterior distribution with a tractable one
** "loopy belief propagation":loopy_belief_propagation, a strategy which is particular to graphical models
