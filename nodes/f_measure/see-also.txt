* "accuracy":accuracy is the "traditional" way to measure the performance of a system but equally weights the positive and negative results, which may not be desirable in an information retrieval system, as the number of negative results (non relevant results) can vastly outweigh the number of positive results (relevant results). However, the F measure is not invariant to label swapping (switching the positive and negative classes) which may not be desirable when e.g. using the F measure with a classifier.
