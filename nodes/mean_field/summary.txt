In variational inference algorithms, we try to approximate an intractable distribution with a tractable one. Mean field is probably the most common example. The approximating distribution is factorized into independent terms corresponding to different variables or groups of variables. Variational Bayes and variational Bayes EM are important applications of mean field to Bayesian parameter estimation.
