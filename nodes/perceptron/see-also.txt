* The perceptron was proposed in the 50s, although it's still in use. More modern algorithms have a similar form, but are put on a more mathematical footing:
** "logistic regression":logistic_regression, which is formulated as a probabilistic model
** "support vector machines (SVMs)":support_vector_machines, which are formulated as an optimization problem
* The perceptron algorithm can be used to "learn to predict structured objects":structural_perceptron (e.g. trees and graphs), not just binary values.
* The perceptron convergence proof requires the assumption that the data are linearly separable by a nonzero margin. "Support vector machines (SVMs)":support_vector_machines are geared towards the same case.
* The perceptron can be "kernelized":kernel_perceptron in order to capture nonlinear dependencies.
