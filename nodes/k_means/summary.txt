K-means is a clustering algorithm, i.e. a way of partitioning a set of data points into "clusters," or sets of data points which are similar to one another. It works by iteratively reassigning data points to clusters and computing cluster centers based on the average of the point locations. It is commonly used for vector quantization and as an initialization for Gaussian mixture models.
