* We can answer conditional probability queries using:
** "variable elimination":gaussian_variable_elimination
** "belief propagation":gaussian_bp_on_trees
* We can "learn the parameters":learning_linear_gaussian_models in a linear-Gaussian model using "linear regression":linear_regression.
* "State-space models":linear_dynamical_systems are an important example of linear-Gaussian models. 
* "Kalman smoothing":kalman_smoother can be "viewed":kalman_smoothing_as_bp" as belief propagation in a linear-Gaussian model.
