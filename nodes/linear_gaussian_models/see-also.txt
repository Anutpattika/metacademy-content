* We can answer conditional probability queries using:
** variable elimination [gaussian-variable-elimination]
** belief propagation [gaussian-bp-on-trees]
* We can learn the parameters in a linear-Gaussian model using linear regression. [learning-linear-gaussian-models]
* State-space models are an important example of linear-Gaussian models. [state-space-models]
* Kalman smoothing can be viewed as belief propagation in a linear-Gaussian model. [kalman-smoothing-as-bp]
