* Other clustering methods include:
** mixture of Gaussians, a probabilistic model for continuous data [gaussian-mixtures-vs-k-means]
** mixture of Bernoullis, a probabilistic model for discrete data [mixture-of-bernoullis]
** spectral clustering, for when the clusters don't have nice convex shapes [spectral-clustering]
