* The eigenvalues of a symmetric PSD matrix are closely related to the singular value decomposition [singular-value-decomposition]
* Some common examples of PSD matrices:
** covariance matrices, which represent dependencies between different random variables [covariance-matrices]
** kernel matrices, a way of representing similarity in machine learning [kernels]
* Semidefinite programming is a very general category of convex optimization problem. [semidefinite-programming]
