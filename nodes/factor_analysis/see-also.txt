* Other models related to factor analysis:
** Principal component analysis (PCA), which finds the maximum variance directions by solving an eigenvalue problem [principal-component-analysis]
** probabilistic PCA, a similar generative model, but where the noise covariance is spherical rather than diagonal [probabilistic-pca]
** probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF), a Bayesian model for predicting missing entries of a matrix [probabilistic-matrix-factorization]
