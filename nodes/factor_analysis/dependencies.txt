tag: multivariate_distributions
reason: Factor analysis defines a joint distribution.

tag: conditional_distributions
reason: We are sometimes interested in the conditional distribution of the latent factors given the observed data, or vice versa.

tag: computations-on-multivariate-gaussians
reason: Factor analysis requires manipulating multivariate Gaussians.

tag: expectation-maximization
reason: We can use EM to learn the parameters.

tag: maximum_likelihood_multivariate_gaussians
reason: The M step involves maximum likelihood for multivariate Gaussians.
