* If we apply the BP update rules in a non-tree graph, it often still works; this is known as "loopy BP":loopy_belief_propagation.
* We can apply (exact) BP to any MRF using the "junction tree representation":junction_trees, although possibly with a large increase in complexity
* The "special case":gaussian_bp_on_trees of Gaussian graphical models
* Some HMM inference algorithms "can be interpreted as belief propagation":hmm_inference_as_bp
* If we have a polytree or chordal MRF, we can convert it to a "factor graph":factor_graphs and then "run BP":factor_graph_bp.
* BP "can be interpreted":loopy_bp_as_variational as fixed point updates to an optimization problem involving Bethe free energy.
