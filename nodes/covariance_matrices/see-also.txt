* The multivariate Gaussian is a widely used distribution parameterized in terms of a mean vector and covariance matrix. [multivariate-gaussian-distribution]
* The Cauchy-Schwartz inequality for covariance follows from the fact that covariance matrices are PSD. [cauchy-schwartz-inequality-probability]
* Principal component analysis is a data analysis method applied to the covariance matrix. [principal-component-analysis]
