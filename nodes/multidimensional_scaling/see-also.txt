* MDS has been "used in cognitive science":mds_in_cog_sci to model human similarity judgments. 
* MDS can be "generalized to metrics other than Euclidean":mds_non_euclidean
* "Weighted MDS":weighted_mds gives a way to uncover meaningful axes by simultaneously modeling multiple similarity matrices
* Other algorithms for learning nonlinear embeddings include:
** "Isomap":isomap, which tries to model distances along a neighborhood graph
** "locally linear embedding":locally_linear_embedding
** "t-SNE":t_sne, an embedding which tries to model short distances and ignore long ones
** "Gaussian process latent variable models":gaussian_process_latent_variable_model, a Bayesian model similar in spirit to MDS
