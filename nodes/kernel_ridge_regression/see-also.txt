* "Gaussian process regression":gaussian_process_regression is a Bayesian version of kernel ridge regression.
* "Kernel support vector machines":kernel_svm are a classification algorithm that uses kernels.
* Unfortunately, the "running time of ridge regression":computational_complexity_of_kernel_methods is cubic in the number of training examples.
