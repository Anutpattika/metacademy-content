* These techniques are used in various models, including:
** Bayesian linear regression [bayesian-linear-regression]
** Bayesian mixture of Gaussians [bayesian-mixture-of-gaussians]
* The Wishart process allows us to model dependencies between different Wishart-distributed random variables. [wishart-process]
* When there's not enough data to estimate a full covariance matrix, here are some related models with more structure:
** principal component analysis (PCA) [principal-component-analysis]
** factor analysis [factor-analysis]
** probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) [probabilistic-matrix-factorization]
** sparse Gaussian graphical models [learning-sparse-gaussian-graphical-models]
