* These techniques are used in various models, including:
** "Bayesian linear regression":bayesian_linear_regression
** "Bayesian mixture of Gaussians":bayesian_mixture_of_gaussians
* The "Wishart process":wishart_process allows us to model dependencies between different Wishart-distributed random variables.
* When there's not enough data to estimate a full covariance matrix, here are some related models with more structure:
** "principal component analysis (PCA)":principal_component_analysis
** "factor analysis":factor_analysis
** "probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF)":probabilistic_matrix_factorization
** "sparse Gaussian graphical models"learning_sparse_gaussian_graphical_models
