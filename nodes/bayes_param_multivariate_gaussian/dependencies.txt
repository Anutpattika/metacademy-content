tag: bayesian-parameter-estimation

tag: maximum-likelihood-multivariate-gaussian
reason: Bayesian parameter estimation for multivariate Gaussians has a similar form to the maximum likelihood estimator.

tag: multivariate-gaussians-information-form
reason: The prior over covariance is easiest to express in information form.

tag: wishart-distribution
reason: The Wishart distribution is the conjugate prior for the precision matrix of a multivariate Gaussian.

tag: student-t-distribution
reason: The predictive distribution is a student-t distribution.

tag: computations-on-multivariate-gaussians
reason: We need to perform various operations with multivariate Gaussians to obtain the posterior over the mean vector.
