* Some examples of convergence in probability:
** the weak law of large numbers [weak-law-of-large-numbers]
* Some other notions of convergence of sequences of random variables:
** convergence in distribution, where the empirical CDF converges to something [convergence-in-distribution]
** almost sure convergence, where the sequence converges to a value with probability 1 [almost-sure-convergence]
