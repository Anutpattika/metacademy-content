* The "Schur product theorem":schur_product_theorem justifies the surprising fact that the product of kernels is a kernel.
* Kernels can be defined on a variety of mathematical objects, allowing us to extend linear machine learning models to those cases:
** "strings":kernels_on_strings
** "graphs":kernels_on_graphs
* "Fisher kernels":fisher_kernel are a general recipe for obtaining a kernel from a generative model.
