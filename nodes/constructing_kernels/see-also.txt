* The Schur product theorem justifies the surprising fact that the product of kernels is a kernel. [schur-product-theorem]
* Kernels can be defined on a variety of mathematical objects, allowing us to extend linear machine learning models to those cases:
** strings [kernels-on-strings]
** graphs [kernels-on-graphs]
* Fisher kernels are a general recipe for obtaining a kernel from a generative model. [fisher-kernel]
