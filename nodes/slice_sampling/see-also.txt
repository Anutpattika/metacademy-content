* The Swendsen-Wang algorithm is a powerful sampling method for Ising models which is a special case of slice sampling. [swendsen-wang]
* Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a special case of slice sampling which uses gradient information to sample from a continuous model [hamiltonian-monte-carlo]
* Slice sampling can be used to eliminate step size parameters from MCMC algorithms. Examples include:
** elliptical slice sampling, for models with a multivariate Gaussian prior [elliptical-slice-sampling]
** the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), a parameter-free version of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo [no-u-turn-sampler]
