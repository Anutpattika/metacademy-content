* Other auxiliary variable sampling methods include:
** The "Swendsen-Wang algorithm":swendsen_wang is a powerful sampling method for Ising models.
** "Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)":hamiltonian_monte_carlo uses gradient information to sample from a continuous model
* Slice sampling can be used to eliminate step size parameters from MCMC algorithms. Examples include:
** "elliptical slice sampling":elliptical_slice_sampling, for models with a multivariate Gaussian prior
** the "No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS)":no_u_turn_sampler, a parameter-free version of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
