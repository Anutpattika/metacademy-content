* Some other versions of the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality:
** for dot products between vectors [dot-product]
** for inner products on Hilbert spaces [cauchy-schwartz-hilbert-spaces]
* The fact that covariance matrices are positive semidefinite is a generalization of this theorem. [covariance-matrices]
