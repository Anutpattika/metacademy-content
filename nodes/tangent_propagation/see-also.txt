* Some other strategies for learning invariances:
** building it explicitly into the architecture, as in convolutional nets [convolutional-nets]
** augmenting the training set with warped examples [augmenting-training-set-warped]
** Tikhonov regularization, which penalizes instability with respect to noise [tikhonov-regularization]
