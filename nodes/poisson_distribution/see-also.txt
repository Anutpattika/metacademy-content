* "Poisson processes":poisson_process are a kind of stochastic process where counts of events within a set follow a Poisson distribution.
* For large values of the scale parameter, the Poisson distribution is well approximated by a Gaussian distribution. This follows from the "Central Limit Theorem":central_limit_theorem.
* The Poisson distribution is a member of the "exponential family":exponential_families.
