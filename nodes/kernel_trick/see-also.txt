* Techniques for "constructing kernels":constructing_kernels
* The kernel trick is used in many machine learning algorithms, including:
** "kernel ridge regression":kernel_ridge_regression
** "kernel support vector machines":kernel_svm
** "Gaussian process regression":gaussian_process_regression
* The theory of "reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces":reproducing_kernel_hilbert_spaces justifies the use of kernelized representations.
