* Techniques for constructing kernels [constructing-kernels]
* The kernel trick is used in many machine learning algorithms, including:
** kernel ridge regression [kernel-ridge-regression]
** kernel support vector machines [kernel-svm]
** Gaussian process regression [gaussian-process-regression]
* The theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces justifies the use of kernelized representations. [reproducing-kernel-hilber-spaces]
