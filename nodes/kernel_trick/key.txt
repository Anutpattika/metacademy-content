* What is the computational cost of ridge regression using an explicit basis function representation?  Using the kernel trick?
* In what situations is it computationally advantageous to use the kernel trick?
* Think about all the machine learning algorithms you know. Which ones only involve dot products, and are therefore kernelizable?
