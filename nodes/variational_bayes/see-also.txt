* Some examples of variational Bayes:
** Mixture of Gaussians [variational-mixture-of-gaussians]
** linear regression [variational-linear-regression]
** logistic regression [variational-logistic-regression]
* Variational Bayes is especially appropriate for fitting exponential families. [variational-exponential-families]
* Other approximations to marginal likelihood include:
** Laplace approximation [laplace-approximation]
** Bayesian information criterion (BIC) [bayesian-information-criterion]
** Sampling algorithms [sampling-for-marginal-likelihood]
** Tree-reweighted belief propagation [tree-reweighted-belief-propagation]
