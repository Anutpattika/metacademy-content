* Examples of computing MGFs: 
** Poisson distribution [mgf-poisson-distribution]
** Gaussian distribution [mgf-gaussian-distribution]
* MGFs are an important tool for proving several important results:
** central limit theorem, which characterizes the limiting distribution of the mean of i.i.d. random variables [central-limit-theorem-proof]
** Chernoff bounds, which bound the probability of sums of random variables taking extreme values [chernoff-bounds-proof]
* MGFs are closely related to the Fourier transform. [mgf-and-fourier-transform]
