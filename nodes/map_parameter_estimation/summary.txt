In Bayesian parameter estimation, unless the prior is specially chosen, often there's no analytical way to integrate out the model parameters. In these cases, maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation is a common approximation, where we choose the parameters which maximize the posterior. Although this is computationally convenient, it has the drawbacks that it's not invariant to parameterization, and that the MAP estimate may not be typical of the posterior.
