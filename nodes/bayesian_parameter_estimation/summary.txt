In the Bayesian framework, we treat the parameters of a statistical model as random variables. The model is specified by a prior distribution over the values of the variables, as well as an evidence model which determines how the parameters influence the observed data. When we condition on the observations, we get the posterior distribution over parameters. The term ``Bayesian parameter estimation'' is deceptive, because often we can skip the parameter estimation step entirely. Rather, we integrate out the parameters and directly make predictions about future observables.
