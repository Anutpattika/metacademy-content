* Conditional independence is fundamental to probabilistic graphical models, including:
** Markov chains, memoryless random sequences where each state is independent of the past conditioned on the previous state [markov-chains]
** Bayesian networks, which (roughly) represent causal structure [bayesian-networks]
** Markov random fields, which model which random variables directly interact with each other [markov-random-fields]
