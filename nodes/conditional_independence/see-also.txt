* Conditional independence is fundamental to probabilistic graphical models, including:
** "Markov models":markov_models, memoryless random sequences where each state is independent of the past conditioned on the previous state
** "Bayesian networks":bayesian_networks, which (roughly) represent causal structure
** "Markov random fields":markov_random_fields, which model which random variables directly interact with each other
