* The determinant is used to define:
** the characteristic polynomial of a matrix, which is important for dealing with eigenvalues [characteristic-polynomial]
** multivariate Gaussians, a widely used probability distribution for multivariate data [multivariate-gaussian-distribution]
* The determinant can also be characterized as:
** the constant term of the characteristic polynomial [characteristic-polynomial]
** the product of the eigenvalues of a matrix [determinant-product-of-eigenvalues]
* The determinant can be computed using:
** the LU factorization [computing-the-determinant]
** the singular value decomposition [computing-the-determinant-svd]
