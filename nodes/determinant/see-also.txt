* The determinant is used to define:
** the "characteristic polynomial":characteristic_polynomial of a matrix, which is important for dealing with eigenvalues
** "multivariate Gaussians":multivariate_gaussian_distribution, a widely used probability distribution for multivariate data
* The determinant can also be characterized as:
** the constant term of the "characteristic polynomial":characteristic_polynomial
** the product of the "eigenvalues":eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors of a matrix
* The determinant can be computed using:
** the "LU factorization":computing_the_determinant
** the "singular value decomposition (SVD)":singular_value_decomposition
