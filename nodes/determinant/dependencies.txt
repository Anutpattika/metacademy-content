tag: matrix_multiplication
reason: The determinant of a product is the product of the determinants.

tag: matrix_inverse
reason: The determinant of the inverse is the inverse of the determinant.

tag: matrix_transpose
reason: the matrix transpose preserves the determinant

tag: gaussian_elimination
reason: The Gaussian elimination operations do nice things to the determinant.
