Intuitively, two events are independent if the first event happening doesn't influence whether the second is likely to occur. Mathematically, some set of events are independent if the joint probability of some subset of the events decomposes into a product of the probabilities of the individual events. In statistics and AI, a probabilistic model often must make independence assumptions in order for things to be efficiently computable.
