* Gaussian processes have a variety of uses in machine learning, including:
** regression [gaussian-process-regression]
** classification [gaussian-process-classification]
** black-box optimization (where we only get to evaluate the function, and doing so is expensive) [bayesian-optimization-with-gaussian-processes]
** reinforcement learning [gaussian-processes-for-reinforcement-learning]
* Techniques for constructing kernel functions [constructing-kernels]
