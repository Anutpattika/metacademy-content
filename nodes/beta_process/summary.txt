The beta process is a random discrete measure that is completely described by a countably infinite set of atoms with each atom having a finite mass. Unlike the Dirichlet process, the weights of the atoms do not have to sum to one, but the masses must be between [0,1], and the marginals of the beta process are not beta distributed. The beta process can be used as a base measure for a Bernoulli process, i.e. to yield a stochastic process for binary random variables.
