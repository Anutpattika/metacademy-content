tag: gaussian-elimination
reason: Gaussian elimination is used to compute the LU factorization.

tag: matrix_multiplication
reason: The matrix is factorized into a product of two matrices.

tag: matrix_inverse
reason: Matrix inverses are needed in deriving the factorization.

tag: matrix_transpose
reason: Matrix transposes are needed in deriving the factorization.
