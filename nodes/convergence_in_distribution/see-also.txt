* Convergence in distribution is used in the statement of the central limit theorem. [central-limit-theorem]
* Other notions of convergence of sequences of random variables:
** convergence in probability, where the probability of being far from the limiting value approaches zero [convergence-in-probability]
** almost sure convergence, where the sequence converges to a value with probability 1 [almost-sure-convergence]
