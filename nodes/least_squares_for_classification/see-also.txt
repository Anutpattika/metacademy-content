* The problem with this algorithm is that the cost function isn't well-suited to classification. Some alternatives which make more sense are:
** logistic regression [logistic-regression]
** support vector machines (SVMs) [support-vector-machines]
* The least squares solution, surprisingly, turns out to be equivalent to Gaussian discriminant analysis. [gda-is-least-squares]
