* Permutation matrices are a special case of:
** orthogonal matrices [orthogonal-matrices]
** doubly stochastic matrices [doubly-stochastic-matrices]
* Permutation matrices are useful for thinking about algorithms such as:
** Gaussian elimination [gaussian-elimination]
** the fast Fourier transform [fast-fourier-transform]
