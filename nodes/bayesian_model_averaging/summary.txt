In model selection, we typically select a single "best" model from a set of candidate models (based upon some selection criteria, such as an AIC score) and then use this model for prediction. Instead of selecting a single "best" model and using it for prediction, Bayesian Model Averaging BMA uses a weighted average of each model's individual prediction for the final predicted value, where the weight is the posterior probability of the model given the data.
