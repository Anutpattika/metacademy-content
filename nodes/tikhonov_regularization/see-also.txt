* Tikhonov regularization is one strategy for learning invariances in neural nets. Others include:
** building it explicitly into the architecture, as in convolutional nets [convolutional-nets]
** augmenting the training set with warped examples [augmenting-training-set-warped]
** tangent propagation, which penalizes instability with respect to transformations [tangent-propagation]
* Denoising autoencoders are a neural net architecture based on the idea of invariance to noise in the inputs. [denoising-autoencoders]
