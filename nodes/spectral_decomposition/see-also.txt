* The spectral decomposition is an example of "diagonalization":diagonalization.
* The spectral decomposition can also be characterized as:
** the "eigenvalues":eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix 
** the "solution to an optimization problem":variational_characterization_of_eigenvalues
* The spectral decomposition "can be generalized":spectral_decomposition_hermitian to complex analogues of symmetric matrices, called "Hermitian matrices":hermitian_matrices
* A symmetric matrix is "positive definite":positive_definite_matrices if its eigenvalues are positive
