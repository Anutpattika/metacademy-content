* The spectral decomposition can also be characterized as:
** the eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix [eigenvalues]
** the solution to an optimization problem [variational-characterization-of-eigenvalues]
* The spectral decomposition can be generalized to complex analogues of symmetric matrices, called Hermitian matrices [spectral-decomposition-hermitian]
* A symmetric matrix is positive semidefinite if its eigenvalues are nonnegative [positive-semidefinite-matrices]
