tag: matrix_transpose
reason: The spectral decomposition applies to symmetric matrices.

tag: orthonormal_bases
reason: The spectral decomposition includes orthogonal factors.

tag: change-of-basis
reason: The spectral decomposition can be viewed as a change of basis.

tag: matrix_inverse
reason: The spectral decomposition gives insight into the inverse of a symmetric matrix.
