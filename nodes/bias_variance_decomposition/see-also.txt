* The variance term depends on the "effective number of parameters":effective_num_parameters of a model.
* "Statistical learning theory":statistical_learning_theory gives a way of analyzing bias and variance of estimators more generally.
* "Cross-validation":cross_validation is a simple and general technique for managing the bias-variance tradeoff. [cross-validation]
