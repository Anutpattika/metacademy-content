* "Variational Bayes":variational_bayes is a class of approximate inference algorithms which try to minimize the KL divergence between distributions.
* KL divergence is a special case of more general families of divergences:
** "alpha divergences":alpha_divergences
** "Bregman divergence":bregman_divergence
* KL divergence is "locally approximated":fisher_information_metric_approximates_kl_divergence by the "Fisher information metric":fisher_information_metric.
* "Mutual information":mutual_information can be "defined":mutual_information_and_kl_divergence in terms of KL divergence.
