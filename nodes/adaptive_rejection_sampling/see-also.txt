* "Adaptive Metropolis rejection sampling":adaptive_metropolis_rejection_sampling is a generalization of ARS that is applicable when the distribution is not log-concave
* ARS can be performed by computing secants (rather than tangents) and thus a can be accomplished without computing the derivative of the log density; see Gilks, W. R. (1992) Derivative-free adaptive rejection sampling for Gibbs sampling. Bayesian Statistics 4,
