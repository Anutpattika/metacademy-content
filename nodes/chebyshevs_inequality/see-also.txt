* Chernoff bounds are another method for bounding the probability of extreme values. [chernoff-bounds]
* The inequality can be extended to higher-order moments. [chebyshev-inequality-higher-order]
* Chebyshev's bound can be used to prove the weak law of large numbers. [weak-law-of-large-numbers-proof]
