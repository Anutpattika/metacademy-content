* Other clustering methods include:
** naive Bayes, a probabilistic model for discrete data [naive-bayes]
** spectral clustering, for when the clusters don't have nice convex shapes [spectral-clustering]
* The application of clustering to finding meaningful regions of images is called image segmentation. [image-segmentation]
