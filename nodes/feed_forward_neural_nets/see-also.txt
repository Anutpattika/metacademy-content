* Neural nets are a form of distributed representation. [distributed-representations]
* Neural nets can be trained using an algorithm called backpropagation. [backpropagation]
* Some examples of neural net architectures:
** convolutional nets, an architecture for vision problems where the weights are replicated across an image [convolutional-nets]
** Boltzmann machines, a kind of neural net used for density modeling [boltzmann-machines]
** deep belief nets, which are used for learning multilayer representations [deep-belief-nets]
** recurrent neural nets, which implement a form of memory over time [recurrent-neural-nets]
* The field of deep learning studies how to automatically construct features using deep neural nets. [deep-learning]
* Connectionist psychology uses neural nets to model human cognition. [connectionist-psychology]
* We can theoretically analyze the representational capacity of neural nets. [representational-capacity-of-neural-nets]
