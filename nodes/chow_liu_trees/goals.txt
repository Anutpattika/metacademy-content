* Be able to formulate the problem of learning tree-structured graphical models as a maximum spanning tree problem.
** What assumptions does this require on the scoring function?
* The algorithm only applies to trees (where a node has at most one parent) rather than polytrees (where a node can have multiple parents). Why does it fail for polytrees?
* Why is the maximum likelihood score an acceptable scoring criterion for tree-based networks, unlike for general Bayes nets?
* Show that the problem can be equivalently viewed as learning the structure of a tree-structured MRF.
