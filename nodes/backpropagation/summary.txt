Backpropagation is the standard algorithm for training supervised feed-forward neural nets. More precisely, it isn't actually a learning algorithm, but a way of computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to the network parameters. Mathematically, it's just an instance of the chain rule for derivatives, but it has an intuitive interpretation in terms of passing messages between the units.
