* "Importance sampling":importance_sampling is a way of getting weighted samples from a distribution and is useful in many of the same situations.
* "Adaptive rejection sampling":adaptive_rejection_sampling is a way to improve the sampler based on the rejected samples [adaptive-rejection-sampling]
* Other commonly used sampling methods include:
** "Gibbs sampling":gibbs_sampling, a generic and widely applicable sampling algorithm
** "particle filters":particle_filter, which are useful for time series modeling
** "Metropolis-Hastings algorithm":metropolis_hastings, which is very general
