* Importance sampling is a way of getting weighted samples from a distribution and is useful in many of the same situations. [importance-sampling]
* Adaptive rejection sampling is a way to improve the sampler based on the rejected samples [adaptive-rejection-sampling]
* Other commonly used sampling methods include:
** Gibbs sampling, a generic and widely applicable sampling algorithm [gibbs-sampling]
** particle filters, which are useful for time series modeling [particle-filter]
** Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, which is very general [metropolis-hastings]
