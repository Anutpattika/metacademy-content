* In order to use GP regression in practice, it is usually necessary to learn the hyperparameters (such as the length scale) from data. [learning-gp-hyperparameters]
* Some other uses for Gaussian processes in machine learning:
** classification [gaussian-process-classification]
** black-box optimization (where we only get to evaluate the function, and doing so is expensive) [bayesian-optimization-with-gaussian-processes]
** reinforcement learning [gaussian-processes-for-reinforcement-learning]
* Techniques for constructing kernel functions [constructing-kernels]
