* We shouldn't expect to learn the parameters exactly in the general case, since inference in MRFs is hard. [complexity-of-inference]
* In the special case of chordal MRFs, the parameters can be learned efficiently. [mrf-parameter-learning-chordal-case]
* Some algorithms for learning the parameters:
** iterative proportional fitting [iterative-proportional-fitting]
** contrastive divergence [contrastive-divergence]
