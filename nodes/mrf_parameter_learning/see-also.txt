* We shouldn't expect to learn the parameters exactly in the general case, since "inference in MRFs is hard":complexity_of_inference.
* In the "special case of chordal MRFs":mrf_parameter_learning_chordal_case, the parameters can be learned efficiently. 
* Some algorithms for learning the parameters:
** "iterative proportional fitting":iterative_proportional_fitting
** "contrastive divergence":contrastive_divergence
