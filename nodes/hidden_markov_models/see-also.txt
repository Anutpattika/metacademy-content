* Some common applications of HMMs:
** speech recognition [hmms-in-speech]
** tracking objects [hmms-for-tracking]
* Hidden semi-Markov models are an elaboration of HMMs which explicitly model the duration distribution of each state [hidden-semi-markov-models]
* We can perform exact inference efficiently in an HMM using the forward-backward algorithm. [forward-backward-algorithm]
* We can learn the parameters of an HMM using the Baum-Welch algorithm. [baum-welch]
* HMMs can be seen as a kind of Bayesian network. [hmms-as-bayes-nets]
* Dynamic Bayes nets are a kind of time series model which has multiple variables at each time step which influence each other [dynamic-bayes-nets]
* The particle filter is a way of performing inference in HMMs when the state space is too large to represent exactly. [particle-filter]
* Kalman filters are a widely used special case of HMMs where all of the variables are Gaussian.
