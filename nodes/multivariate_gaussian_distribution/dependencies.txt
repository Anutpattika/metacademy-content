tag: gaussian-distribution

tag: covariance-matrices
reason: The multivariate Gaussian distribution is parameterized in terms of a mean vector and covariance matrix.

tag: determinant
reason: The determinant of the covariance matrix is part of the normalizing constant.

tag: matrix_inverse
reason: The inverse of the covariance matrix is part of the PDF.
