* The variance of the importance weights depends on a Renyi divergence between the two distributions. [analyzing-importance-sampling]
* Importance sampling is ineffective except in simple situations. More sophisticated versions include:
** Sequential importance resampling (SIR) [sequential-importance-resampling]
** particle filters [particle-filter]
