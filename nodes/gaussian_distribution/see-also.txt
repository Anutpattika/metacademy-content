* Mathematical tricks for manipulating Gaussian distributions [gaussian-distribution-tricks]
* Multivariate Gaussians are a generalization of Gaussian distributions to multiple variables. [multivariate-gaussian-distribution]
* We see Gaussian distributions in a wide variety of situations:
** By the central limit theorem, sums of large numbers of independent random variables are approximately Gaussian [central-limit-theorem]
** In statistical inference, the variance of an estimator often becomes Gaussian as more data points are observed [maximum-likelihood-asymptotic-normality]
* Gaussian distributions have weak, tails, in that they are unlikely to take extreme values; many phenomena are better modeled by heavy-tailed distributions. [heavy-tailed-distributions]
* Gaussians are widely used in computer science because they allow computationally efficient methods for accounting for dependencies between different variables. [computations-on-multivariate-gaussians]
* Probability distributions related to the Gaussian distribution:
** The gamma distribution is often used to construct a prior for the variance parameter. [bayesian-parameter-estimation-gaussian]
** The sum of squares of Gaussian random variables follows a chi-squared distribtuion. [chi-squared-distribution]
