* "Multivariate Gaussians":multivariate_gaussian_distribution are a generalization of Gaussian distributions to multiple variables.
* We see Gaussian distributions in a wide variety of situations:
** By the "central limit theorem":central_limit_theorem, sums of large numbers of independent random variables are approximately Gaussian
** In statistical inference, the variance of an estimator often "approaches a Gaussian":maximum_likelihood_asymptotic_normality as more data points are observed
* Gaussian distributions have weak, tails, in that they are unlikely to take extreme values; many phenomena are better modeled by "heavy-tailed distributions":heavy_tailed_distributions.
* Gaussians are widely used in computer science because they allow "computationally efficient methods":computations_on_multivariate_gaussians for accounting for dependencies between different variables.
* Probability distributions related to the Gaussian distribution:
** The "gamma distribution":gamma_distribution is often used to construct a "prior for the variance parameter":bayesian_parameter_estimation_gaussian.
** The sum of squares of Gaussian random variables follows a "chi-squared distribtuion":chi_squared_distribution. [chi-squared-distribution]
* "Information form":gaussian_information_form is an alternative parameterization for Gaussian distributions.
* How to "sample from a Gaussian distribution":sampling_from_gaussian_distribution
