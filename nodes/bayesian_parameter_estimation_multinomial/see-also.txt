* Some examples of models that use Dirichlet-multinomial distributions:
** Bayesian mixture of Gaussians [bayesian-mog]
** latent Dirichlet allocation [latent-dirichlet-allocation]
* The Chinese restaurant process is an analogue of the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution to infinitely many mixture components. [chinese-restaurant-process]
