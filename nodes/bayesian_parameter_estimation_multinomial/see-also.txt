* Some examples of models that use Dirichlet-multinomial distributions:
** "Bayesian mixture of Gaussians":bayesian_mixture_of_gaussians
** "latent Dirichlet allocation":latent_dirichlet_allocation
* The "Chinese restaurant process":chinese_restaurant_process is an analogue of the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution to infinitely many mixture components.
