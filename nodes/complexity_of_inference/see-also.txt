* When exact inference is infeasible, we must resort to approximate inference algorithms, such as:
** loopy belief propagation, which applies the BP update rules on non-tree graphs [loopy-belief-propagation]
** Markov chain Monte Carlo, a sampling-based method [markov-chain-monte-carlo]
** variational inference, which tries to find a tractable approximation to the posterior [variational-inference]
