* When there's not enough data to estimate a full covariance matrix, here are some related models with more structure:
** principal component analysis (PCA) [principal-component-analysis]
** factor analysis [factor-analysis]
** probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) [probabilistic-matrix-factorization]
** sparse Gaussian graphical models [learning-sparse-gaussian-graphical-models]
