* Some uses of Jensen's inequality:
** showing that "KL divergence":kl_divergence, a measure of distance between probability distributions, is nonnegative
** showing that the "EM algorithm":expectation_maximization "increases the likelihood function":expectation_maximization_variational_interpretation
** "variational Bayes":variational_bayes, a general framework for approximate inference in probabilistic models
** the "Rao-Blackwell theorem":rao_blackwell_theorem, which shows that estimators should only consider sufficient statistics is the loss function is convex
