The Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDPs) is a stochastic process that can be used to define a nonparametric distribution on a mixture of mixtures (or admixture) model. That is, each grouping of data is a draw from a mixture model, and the mixture components are shared among the different groups. Using a hierarchy of Dirichlet processes lets us infer the number of mixture components from the data. HDPs are most commonly used in topic modeling, where
