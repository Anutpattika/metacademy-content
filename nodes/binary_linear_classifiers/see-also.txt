* Here are some commonly used binary classification algorithms:
** perceptron [perceptron]
** logistic regression [logistic-regression]
** support vector machines (SVMs) [support-vector-machines]
** Gaussian discriminant analysis [gaussian-discriminant-analysis]
** naive Bayes [naive-bayes]
* Other kinds of targets include:
** real-valued [linear-regression]
** categorical [multiway-classification]
** ordinal (i.e. only the ranking matters) [ordinal-regression]
* We want our classifier to generalize well to new data, not just perform well on the data it's already seen. [generalization]
* Some general techniques for improving generalization include:
** regularization, where overly complex solutions are penalized [regularization]
** model selection [model-selection]
** feature selection [feature-selection]
* Not all variables of interest can be modeled as linear functions of the input variables. To model nonlinear dependencies, check out:
** basis function expansions [basis-function-expansions]
** neural networks [feed-forward-neural-nets]
** kernel methods [kernel-svm]
