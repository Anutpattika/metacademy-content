* Other algorithms for learning nonlinear embeddings include:
** Isomap, which tries to model distances along a neighborhood graph [isomap]
** locally linear embedding [locally-linear-embedding]
** t-SNE, an embedding which tries to model short distances and ignore long ones [t-sne]
** Gaussian process latent variable models, a Bayesian model similar in spirit to MDS [gaussian-process-latent-variable-model]
