* The "Brouwer fixed point theorem":brouwer_fixed_point_theorem implies that loopy BP has at least one fixed point.
* Loopy BP "can be viewed":loopy_bp_as_variational as a "variational inference":variational_inference algorithm which tries to minimize the Bethe free energy. 
* In the case of Gaussian graphical models, loopy BP is "guaranteed to converge":gaussian_loopy_belief_propagation to the correct mean. 
* Loopy BP is "guaranteed to converge":loopy_bp_single_loop in graphs with a single loop.
