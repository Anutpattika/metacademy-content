* We often want to do one of the following in Gaussian MRFs:
** answer conditional probability queries [inference-in-gaussian-mrfs]
** learn the parameters [gaussian-mrf-parameter-learning]
* There are also Gaussian Bayes nets, and the structure shows up in the Cholesky factorization of the covariance matrix. [linear-gaussian-models]
* Important special cases include
** Gauss-Markov processes [gauss-markov-processes]
** grid-structured Gaussian MRFs [grid-structured-gaussian-mrfs]
* Gaussian conditional random fields (CRFs) are useful in low-level image processing. [crfs-image-processing]
* Many algorithms which are inefficient or inexact for general MRFs are efficient and exact for Gaussian MRFs. Examples include:
** inferring the mean with loopy belief propagation [gaussian-loopy-belief-propagation]
** learning the parameters [gaussian-mrf-parameter-learning]
